# Lecture Notes on Online Influence and Persuasion

## Module Overview
- Focus on online influence, persuasion, social theory, neuroscience, and AI.
- Importance of combining theoretical frameworks with empirical data analysis.

## Scientific Method
- **Steps**: Observe → Hypothesize → Collect Data → Analyze → Conclude.
- Avoid drawing conclusions solely from data to prevent spurious correlations.

## Objectives
1. Explain the counterintuitive nature of social media influence.
2. Describe common theories of influence and persuasion.
3. Discuss how platforms manipulate user behavior.

## Misinformation Definitions
- **Misinformation**: Incorrect information without intent to mislead.
- **Disinformation**: False information intended to mislead.
- **Malformation**: Truthful information presented negatively.
- **Propaganda**: Biased information to persuade, can be true or false.

## Influence and Persuasion Theories
- **Social Judgment Theory**: Attitudes and beliefs exist on a spectrum (latitude of acceptance, rejection, non-commitment).
- **Boomerang Effect**: Strong arguments can push beliefs further away from acceptance.

## Rumor Correction
- Correcting misinformation can lead to increased belief in falsehoods (belief echoes).
- Empirical evidence shows that attempts to correct misinformation often backfire.

## Neuroscience of Influence
- **James-Lange Theory**: Emotions arise from physiological responses to stimuli.
- **System 1 and System 2 Thinking**: Automatic vs. rational thought processes.
- **Dopamine**: Key in motivation and addiction, influenced by social media interactions.

## Narrative Transport
- Engaging narratives can overcome counter-arguing and enhance persuasion.
- Effective narratives include relatable characters, clear goals, and emotional engagement.

## Platform Manipulation
- Social media algorithms prioritize engagement, influencing what content is seen.
- Techniques include using bots and state-sponsored accounts to amplify messages.

## Firestorm Behavior
- Negative campaigns can create rapid spikes in attention but typically fade quickly.
- Responding to firestorms can prolong their impact and increase counter-arguments.

## Majority Illusion and Pluralistic Ignorance
- Perception of majority opinions can skew behavior and beliefs.
- Social media often amplifies minority views, creating a false sense of majority support.

## Behavioral Change Model
- Behavioral intention is influenced by:
  - Attitudinal beliefs
  - Injunctive norms (opinion leaders)
  - Descriptive norms (peer influence)
  - Behavioral control (efficacy)

## Conclusion
- Understanding the interplay of social theory, neuroscience, and online behavior is crucial for effective communication and influence strategies.
