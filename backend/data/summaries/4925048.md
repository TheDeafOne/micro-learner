# Lecture Notes on Regression and Logistic Regression

## Overview of Regression
- **Purpose**: To compute numerical values for predictions (e.g., flu arrival rates, stock market indices).
- **Types of Regression**:
  - **Linear Regression**: Predicts a dependent variable using a linear equation.
  - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Involves multiple independent variables.
  - **Quadratic Regression**: Fits a quadratic curve to data.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification based on the logistic curve.

## Linear Regression
- **Equation**: \( y = b_0 + b_1 x \)
- **Cost Function**: Typically uses L2 norm (squared errors).
- **Residuals**: Difference between actual and predicted values.
- **Advantages**:
  - Provides real numerical values.
  - Can be adapted for classification (e.g., logistic regression).
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Sensitive to outliers.
  - May not fit well for non-linear data (illustrated by Anscombe's quartet).

## Metrics for Evaluation
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average of absolute errors.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average of squared errors.
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Percentage error averaged over all predictions.

## Logistic Regression
- **Purpose**: To model binary outcomes (0 or 1) using a sigmoid function.
- **Sigmoid Function**: Restricts output to the range [0, 1], making it suitable for probability estimation.
- **Implementation**:
  - Uses optimization to fit the logistic curve to probabilistic data.
  - Can handle missing data effectively.
  
## Classifier Comparison
- **Logistic Regression vs. Other Classifiers**:
  - Logistic regression is a probabilistic model, unlike SVM (distance-based) or Naive Bayes (assumes Gaussian distribution).
  - It does not assume a specific distribution of the underlying data.

## Practical Application: Breast Cancer Prediction
- **Dataset**: Patient diagnosis data used to predict cancer recurrence.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values and categorical variables (using one-hot encoding).
  - Check for balance in the dataset (ideally 50% recurrence).
- **Model Training**:
  - Use logistic regression from scikit-learn.
  - Evaluate model performance using accuracy and F1 score.
- **Feature Importance**: Analyze which features (e.g., tumor size, degree malignant) are most predictive of outcomes.

## Conclusion
- Regression techniques, particularly logistic regression, are powerful tools in predictive modeling.
- Understanding the nuances of each method, including their advantages and limitations, is crucial for effective application in real-world scenarios.
