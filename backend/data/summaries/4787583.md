# Lecture Notes on APIs and Legal Issues in Data Collection

## Module Overview
- **Instructor:** Dr. Ian Mccullough
- **Focus:** Understanding APIs, particularly in social media, and the legal implications of data collection.

## Key Themes
1. **Dynamic Nature of Social Media APIs**
   - APIs frequently change due to platform issues, data value fluctuations, and user behavior.
   - Past experiences show that scripts may break unexpectedly, necessitating adaptability.

2. **Learning to Write Scripts**
   - Emphasis on teaching students to write their own scripts rather than relying on provided APIs.
   - Collaboration among students is encouraged through discussion threads.

3. **Objectives of the Module**
   - Describe common social media API formats.
   - Familiarize with social media platforms and data extraction methods.
   - Understand US case law affecting social media data collection.

## Legal Issues in Data Collection
### Online Trespass
- **Concept:** Accessing a platform without permission may be likened to trespassing.
- **Key Case:** Bidders Edge vs. eBay (2000) - Established that heavy traffic disrupting service can lead to liability, but scraping itself isn't inherently trespass.

### Copyright Issues
- Scraping data for facts is generally acceptable (fair use), but directly copying content may violate copyright.
- **Key Cases:**
  - Facebook vs. Power.com - Scraping was claimed as copyright violation.
  - Associated Press vs. Meltwater - Scraping and publishing articles was challenged.

### Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
- Protects online platforms from user copyright violations.
- Includes provisions for notice and takedown procedures for infringing content.

### Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- Addresses unauthorized access to computer systems.
- Important for understanding the legality of scraping and data collection.

### Privacy Concerns
- Platforms have a responsibility to protect user data.
- Notable cases include Snapchat and Twitter facing lawsuits for mishandling user data.

## API Formats
### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- Human-readable format using name-value pairs.
- Commonly used for APIs due to efficiency and ease of use.

### XML (Extensible Markup Language)
- Uses tags to structure data.
- Still in use due to familiarity and readability despite being less efficient than JSON.

## Best Practices for API Development
1. **Support Business Use Cases**
   - Limit data exposure to what is necessary for third-party interaction.
2. **Documentation**
   - Provide clear, detailed documentation for ease of use.
3. **Stability**
   - Maintain API stability to avoid breaking existing applications.

## Conclusion
- The burden of privacy protection lies with the platform.
- Publicly available data is generally fair game for collection.
- Students will create scripts for data collection, experiencing the challenges of changing APIs firsthand.
