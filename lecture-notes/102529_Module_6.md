- Purpose and context
  - Decision trees are foundational for random forest classifiers.
  - Decision trees provide interpretable (non-blackbox) classification useful for sharing with subject-matter experts.

- Example dataset (customer tipping)
  - Features: food (bad/ok/good), service speed (speedy/not), price (okay/not).
  - Target: tip (yes/no).
  - Dataset represented as a pandas DataFrame; categorical levels mapped to integers (e.g., bad=0, ok=1, good=2; no=0, yes=1).
  - Ordinal encoding chosen instead of one-hot because feature levels have a natural order (bad < ok < good).

- Building the model (scikit-learn)
  - Use LabelEncoder for targets, extract X and y matrices, fit DecisionTreeClassifier to the data.
  - Export the learned tree using export_graphviz to a .dot graph description file (features and class names included).
  - Graphviz/dot used to render the tree graphic (dot is a graph description language). Example install mention: conda install python-graph (graphviz-related).

- Visualization and interpretation
  - Visualized tree nodes show feature splits (e.g., "food > 1.5" indicates food == good).
  - Leaves show predicted class (tip yes/no) matching the dataset decisions.
  - Visual tree aids discussion with subject-matter experts (e.g., petal width threshold indicates class).

- Iris dataset example
  - Decision tree fit to iris data produced a tree where petal width is the most important feature.
  - A specific split example: petal width threshold around 0.8 substantially reduces impurity and separates classes (versicolor, etc.).

- Impurity measures and feature importance
  - Gini index (described as an index of entropy) shown at nodes; values decrease down the tree as decisions reduce impurity.
  - Petal width identified as the feature that reduces impurity the most in the iris example.

- Decision tree algorithms and properties
  - ID3 algorithm: conceptually tries combinations of features/values but entropy-based selection reduces search.
  - Exhaustive truth-table grows exponentially with features; entropy-based heuristics avoid full enumeration.
  - Decision trees use greedy optimization strategies, are fast, and follow Occam’s razor (prefer simpler trees that reduce entropy early).
  - Further algorithmic details left for deeper study.

- Dataset
  - Titanic preprocessed dataset: 891 rows, ≈7 columns (many binary; some numerical like age and fare).
  - Class distribution: ~61% not survived (class 0), ~38% survived (class 1).

- Data exploration / feature observations
  - Older passengers tended not to survive; some infants survived more.
  - Females survived more than males.
  - Higher-class (first-class) passengers had a higher survival rate compared to lower classes.
  - Fare shows strong discrimination with class (higher fare → higher survival).
  - Several features have near-zero correlation with the class (likely useless features).

- Feature ranking / reduction
  - Correlation with class used to rank features; fare, age, family size, ticket-related features show higher correlation.
  - Removing low-correlation features reduced the feature set to 25 features (simple threshold-based reduction).

- Evaluation protocol
  - Tenfold cross-validation used for all evaluations.
  - Mean accuracy and standard deviation reported.

- Baseline classifiers (on original full feature set)
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes: ~45% accuracy (high variance across folds noted).
  - Linear SVC: ~80% accuracy.
  - Linear SVC with balanced class weights: ~74%.
  - RBF SVC (one set of parameters): ~66%; with different gamma: ~73%.
  - Logistic regression: ~81%.
  - Neural network: ~84% (best single classifier reported).
  - Random forest: consistently high (not numerically specified here) due to internal feature selection.

- Ensemble of weak learners setup
  - Weak learner: Gaussian/Naive Bayes.
  - Ensemble built by training many weak learners, each on a random subset of features (without replacement).
  - For each weak learner, the exact feature subset is stored and used at prediction time.
  - Ensemble prediction by majority voting across weak learners.
  - Ensemble sizes tested up to hundreds (examples: 100, 200, 211 weak learners).
  - Experiments repeated (e.g., 10 iterations) to collect statistics.

- Ensemble behavior and intermediate results
  - Ensemble of naive Bayes on random feature subsets (without prior feature reduction) increased mean accuracy slightly in one run (from 45% to 48%) but with very large standard deviation (~13%).
  - In another run, ensemble performance dropped (e.g., to ~39%) with very low std — caused by many weak learners lacking access to informative features; Naive Bayes treats all features equally and cannot select informative ones.
  - Random forest not affected because decision trees select informative features using information gain/Gini.

- Effect of feature reduction on Naive Bayes and ensemble
  - Pure Naive Bayes on reduced 25-feature set: ~76% accuracy.
  - Ensemble Naive Bayes on reduced set (ensemble size 211, 10 iterations): ~78% accuracy with lower standard deviation (~±3.5%), showing improved robustness over single Naive Bayes (~±4.5%).
  - Ensemble provided better generalization (lower variance) than plain Naive Bayes after feature reduction.

- Feature-count sensitivity experiment
  - Varying number of top-ranked features from few up to 35:
    - Plain Naive Bayes performance is highly sensitive to which and how many features are included; large variance when many features (including useless ones) are used.
    - Ensemble Naive Bayes is more robust and less sensitive; performance plateaus after ~15 features, maintaining good accuracy (~76%) with lower standard deviation.
    - Using all features can hurt plain Naive Bayes due to inclusion of detrimental features.

- Key technical reasons identified
  - Naive Bayes treats all features equally (no internal feature selection), so ensembles of naive Bayes with random subsets suffer when many subsets miss informative features.
  - Decision-tree-based ensembles (random forest) implicitly select informative features during training, making them robust to irrelevant features.
  - Pre-selecting informative features (e.g., via correlation ranking) substantially improves both single Naive Bayes and Naive Bayes ensembles.

- Overall empirical conclusions (data-only)
  - On this Titanic dataset: feature ranking + reduction to informative features increased Naive Bayes accuracy from ~45% to ~76%.
  - Ensemble of Naive Bayes on reduced feature set further improved accuracy to ~78% and reduced standard deviation, yielding more robust generalization than single Naive Bayes.
  - Ensembles of weak Naive Bayes learners without prior feature selection can perform poorly or have high variance because many weak learners may lack access to the informative features.
