- Machine learning defined as solving computation problems with a computer without an explicit program.
- First module covers a complete machine learning pipeline: develop a model, test on never-seen-before data points, and evaluate the model.
- Practical task: recognize handwritten digits on mail envelopes to assist postal workers.
- Model/algorithm: support vector machine for classifying digit images from envelopes.
- Performance metric mentioned: accuracy.
- Implementation environment: Jupyter Notebook (to be used in every lecture).

- Plotting setup
  - matplotlib used with inline backend (alternative: notebook backend for widget display).

- Imports
  - scikit-learn (sklearn) datasets, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and metrics imported.

- Dataset used
  - Digits dataset: images of handwritten digits collected ~20+ years ago for USPS zip code automation.
  - Built-in scikit-learn dataset for quick experimentation.

- Notebook and execution practice
  - Restart and clear kernel before running notebook to reset state.
  - Run cells with Shift+Enter.
  - HTML version of the notebook provided separately.

- Data loading and inspection
  - Loaded dataset is a dictionary-like object containing keys such as data, target, images, target_names, and DESCR (description).
  - Data is a NumPy array represented as a 2D matrix: rows = individual data points (instances), columns = features.
  - Target is an array of labels (integers for this dataset); target names in other datasets could be strings (e.g., flower names).
  - Images are included as an images key for display purposes but not used directly for analytics in this example.
  - DESCR contains dataset source and publication references.

- Feature engineering and data types
  - Feature engineering involves converting raw inputs (e.g., pixel colors) into a matrix suitable for machine learning.
  - Basic variable types: numerical (integers, floats), nominal/categorical; other types include boolean, text, date.
  - Correct representation and formatting of data types is crucial for machine learning.

- Data dimensionality terminology
  - Matrix size characterized by number of rows (N = instances) and number of columns (M = features).

- Next step
  - Use a classifier (SVM) to classify the digit images using the loaded dataset.

- Dataset size: 1,797 images.
- Each image: 8 rows × 8 columns (8×8 matrix).
- Labels: digits 0–9; labels appear to change in order across the dataset (images entered sequentially).
- First 40 images plotted as a 4×10 grid (figure size 20×10); images shown with gray colormap, nearest interpolation, title “training” for each subplot, axis turned off.
- Individual data point representation: image shown as an 8×8 matrix; the associated label appears as the last element for that data point.
- Flattening: each 8×8 image converted to a 1×64 vector for input to machine learning algorithms.
- Resulting data matrix shape after flattening: 1,797 rows × 64 columns (each row = one data point; each column = one pixel feature, indexed 0–63 or 1–64).
- Emphasized checks during data ingest: verify matrix dimensions and values to avoid propagating errors through the pipeline.
- Preprocessing importance: majority of effort spent on preprocessing; aim is model generalization rather than fitting training data details or outliers.
- Common preprocessing tasks and pitfalls: correct input errors (format and semantic), impute missing values, and avoid data preparation mistakes that can cause poor generalization or misleading model performance.
- Note on training order: data order affects model outputs for some algorithms (example: Random Forests require randomized input order for stable results).

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Trained faster than artificial neural networks (algorithmic complexity ~O(n^2) vs ~O(n^3) for ANNs).
  - Often better generalization than ANNs.
  - SVM seeks a discriminating plane and reduces marginal risk; ANNs perform function approximation by minimizing input-output error.

- Implementation details
  - SVM classifier defined with radial basis function (RBF) kernel, gamma = 0.001.
  - Classifier fitted to data; predictions compared to expected labels from dataset.

- Data splitting
  - Integer division operator // in Python used (n_samples // 2).
  - First half of dataset (0 : n//2) used for training; second half (n//2 : end) used for testing.
  - Example sample size referenced: 1797 samples → test/training sizes computed via //2.

- Performance measurement
  - Basic metric: accuracy = correct predictions / total predictions.
  - For multi-class (10 classes) use confusion matrix (columns = predicted classes, rows = actual classes).
  - scikit-learn used to generate classification report and confusion matrix.

- Classification report contents
  - Per-class: precision, recall, F1-score, support.
  - Overall: accuracy, macro average, weighted average.

- Confusion matrix observations
  - Diagonal elements indicate correct class predictions.
  - Class 0: precision = 1.0, recall ≈ 0.99 (virtually never missed).
  - Digit 4:
    - 88% of digit-4 instances predicted correctly as 4.
    - Some digit-0 instances (~1%) predicted as 4.
    - ~4% of actual digit-4 instances predicted as 9 (shape similarity to 9).
  - Digit 9: confused with multiple other digits (0,1,2,3,4,5...).
  - Confusion matrix used to identify which classes are commonly mixed up.

- Visual inspection of predictions
  - Random examples shown where Prediction = Ground Truth (e.g., 8 predicted as 8).
  - Indexing for visuals required adding offset to match enumerated expected labels.
  - Examples at indices 20–24 were all correct.
  - Example misprediction at index ~30: predicted 9 but ground truth 5; visually looks like a 5 to a human.

- Additional notes
  - Using only 50% of data for training makes classification more difficult.
  - Improvements suggested: more training or a better neural network architecture.
  - Upcoming/related topics: matrices, data preprocessing, further classification and clustering problems.
