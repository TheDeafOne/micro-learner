- Definition: data reduction = removing data features (ranking/selecting features), not removing data points; goal is to identify which independent variables explain the model’s captured knowledge.

- Dataset/example: breast cancer dataset with 9 input features (X) and a binary target (Y = cancer recurred or not). Supervised learning baseline accuracy ≈ 75–77% (up to ≈78%).

- Feature selection method: used SelectPercentile with scoring via log(probabilities) (np.log of selector probabilities divided by max) to map and scale scores.

- Feature ranking/results: highest information from "degree malignant", "node-caps", and "inverted-nodes". Lower contributors include "age", "menopause", "breast-quad" (removing those had little impact).

- Experiments removing features:
  - Removing four low-contribution features produced similar classifier accuracy (~75% vs baseline up to ~78%).
  - Further removing "menopause" and "breast-quad" still produced minimal accuracy loss; sometimes small increases observed between runs (examples: ~74.5% vs ~75.0%).

- Variability and interpretation:
  - Randomness in experiments causes performance to fluctuate between runs.
  - Small observed accuracy increases may be within random variation and not true improvements.
  - Recommendation/guideline given: treating increases < ~3–5% cautiously (not automatically called improvements) unless supported by statistical confidence.
  - Statistical approach: run many trials, compute confidence intervals or significance tests to assess whether observed differences are real (example: reporting 75.0% with 99% confidence).

- Rationale for data reduction beyond accuracy: producing a small set of variables to present to domain experts for interpretation (e.g., clinicians likely focus on node-caps, inverted-nodes, degree malignant).

- Discussion prompts:
  1. Provide an example where data reduction does nothing or hinders performance.
  2. Define when a performance increase (e.g., accuracy) should be considered a true improvement (statistical confidence and other methods suggested).

- Dataset: features include age, tumor size, inverted nodes and recurrence (recurrence used as class/color in visualization).
- Copied dataframe into a second variable (shallow copy) to avoid breaking the global df in the notebook; deep copy may be required in other situations.
- Converted all categorical/object features to numeric; float is preferred over integer for algorithms.
- Clustering typically requires numeric features because it uses a distance metric; alternative similarity approaches (set similarity, frequency/probability-based) exist but are rare.
- 3D scatter (matplotlib) of features showed a clumped blob with poor dynamic range (values roughly 0–100).
- K-means clustering was applied withholding recurrence as ground truth; clustering score ≈ 0.49 (close to random for two classes, random baseline ~0.5).
- Normalization (min-max): x' = (x - min) / (max - min) maps features to [0,1].
- Standardization: transform to zero mean and unit standard deviation; useful for probabilistic methods (e.g., Naive Bayes).
- Normalization/standardization equalize feature scales, producing a more spherical optimization surface and improving optimizer behavior for many algorithms.
- Min-max scaling (fit_transform) applied to three features (e.g., age, tumor size, inverted nodes) produced a more evenly distributed range and equalized feature influence.
- Euclidean distance in n-dimensions used for clustering: distance between two n-feature vectors determines cluster grouping by minimizing within-cluster distances.
- After normalization/standardization, visualization improved (zeros centered, features on equal scale) but clustering error remained high—recurrence did not align with clusters, indicating clustering alone cannot recover the recurrence label.
- Conclusion from example: scaling/transformation does not remove information but makes features comparable; however, some targets (like cancer recurrence) may require supervised learning because they do not manifest as separable clusters in the feature space.

- Visualize preprocessed data points to confirm preprocessing improves the dataset.

- One-hot encoding for nominal (object) features:
  - Nominal variables produce one new column per level.
  - Example: menopause has three levels (ge40, lt40, premeno) → three columns; a 1 in one column implies 0 in the others.
  - Six nominal variables identified; an encode_one_hot function was built and applied to four remaining variables.
  - One-hot encoding converts nominal levels to numeric inputs required by numerical classifiers (e.g., random forest).

- Target (recurrence) handling:
  - Recurrence is not one-hot encoded for the random forest classifier; the RF accepts integer labels (0,1,2,3 or binary 0/1).
  - For neural networks, the output layer would be one-hot encoded for a binary outcome.

- Dataset class balance:
  - Dataset is unbalanced (examples reported as roughly non-recurrent ~238 vs recurrent ~80; other mentions: non-recurrent 205 vs recurrent 86).
  - Because of imbalance, use stratified sampling in cross-validation so fold class proportions reflect the original dataset.

- Evaluation methods compared:
  - 80% train / 20% test random split (results vary run-to-run).
  - Leave-one-out (LOO) — feasible only for small datasets; impractical for large N.
  - 10-fold cross-validation — common approach.
  - Stratified 10-fold cross-validation — preferred when classes are imbalanced.

- Random forest experiments and settings:
  - Feature matrix X = all features except recurrence; labels y = recurrence.
  - scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier used with n_estimators = 200 and n_jobs = 4 (parallelism).
  - Results vary across random splits (example accuracies ranged ~64–77% on repeated 80/20 splits).
  - Use repeated runs or cross-validation (10-fold or repeated 100 runs) to collect accuracy statistics and standard deviation.
  - Timing example: a cell run took ~26 seconds (depends on hardware).
  - Hyperparameters that affect performance: n_estimators, max_depth, random_state, number of parallel jobs; RF is robust with default/ballpark settings but can be tuned with validation data.
  - Setting random_state fixes randomness and yields repeatable results; removing it produces variable outcomes.

- Practical notes:
  - Run stratified 10-fold cross-validation to get stable performance estimates on unbalanced data.
  - Leave-one-out useful only for very small datasets.
  - Next step indicated: data transformation.

# Summary of dataset preprocessing steps and findings

- Dataset and tools
  - File: module03_breast_cancer.csv
  - Editors/tools: Notepad++, Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy, scikit-learn (mentioned), Weka (mentioned)
  - Target variable: last column "recurrence"; features: preceding nine columns (separated into X matrix and y vector)

- Raw data issues identified
  - Duplicate rows (exact duplicates and contradictory duplicates where same features had different recurrence labels)
  - Missing values represented as NaN and as question marks ("?")
  - Incorrect entries/outliers (examples: age = -5, tumor-size = 250)
  - Inconsistent quoting for nominal values (single/double quotes, causing numeric values to be read as strings)
  - Potential delimiter ambiguity in CSVs (commas vs semicolons)
  - Mixed data types: float64/int64 for numeric, object for nominal

- Exploration and visualization
  - Scatter plots of tumor-size vs age using Seaborn, colored by recurrence and faceted/colored by degree-malignant (levels 1,2,3)
  - Kernel density estimation used to color points by density
  - Observed degree-malignant as a strong discriminator: level 1 associated with non-recurrence, level 3 associated with recurrence

- Duplicate handling
  - pandas.duplicated() used to find duplicates
  - Removed duplicates (5 rows removed)
  - Flagged contradictory duplicates (same features but different recurrence) as data contradictions

- Missing value handling
  - Checked for NaNs with DataFrame.any()
  - Numerical imputation: computed means (using NumPy mean and DataFrame.mean) and filled NaNs with means
    - Example imputed means: age → 56, tumor-size → 28, inverted nodes → 3.5
  - Nominal imputation: compute frequencies and impute mode; alternative stochastic imputation by sampling according to observed category probabilities
  - For missing target (recurrence), recommended dropping those rows for supervised classification (useful only for unsupervised tasks like clustering)

- Nominal variable checks
  - Used unique() and value_counts() to inspect levels
  - Example for node_caps: counts = no:227, yes:56, missing:10 → imputation choices either assign most frequent class or sample by probabilities (e.g., yes probability = 56/283)

- Data-type considerations
  - Verified dtypes (float64, int64 for numerics; object for nominals)
  - Noted possible conversions (e.g., int → float) if needed

- Corrections and unresolved items
  - Corrected obvious incorrect entries when possible (example: 250 corrected)
  - Some erroneous values (example: age = -5) remained and require subject-matter-expert verification before final decision

- Next step
  - After cleaning and imputation, proceed to discretization (to be covered in the next module)
