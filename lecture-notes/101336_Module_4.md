- Centrality measures discussed earlier describe a single node's influence (direct exposure, brokerage/betweenness, closeness/average distance). The focus here is on group-level graph measures: cohesion, vulnerability, single points of failure.

- Diameter
  - Defined as the longest shortest path (longest geodesic length) in the network.
  - Geodesic length counts links (edges), not nodes.
  - Examples:
    - Star-shaped network: diameter = 2 (no shortest path requires 3 links).
    - Ring (cycle) network: diameter = 3 (there are shortest paths of length 3 between some node pairs; multiple geodesics of length 3 can exist, e.g., between node 3 and node 6).
  - Practical method: enumerate all geodesics and take the maximum length.

- Density
  - Defined as the proportion of actual links to all possible links. For n nodes, maximum possible undirected links = n(n−1)/2 (example: 5 nodes → 10 possible edges).
  - Example (military platoon with 5 nodes: platoon leader (PL), platoon sergeant (PSG), three squad leaders L1, L2, L3):
    - Low-communication configuration: 3 of 10 possible edges present → density = 0.3. Consequences: vulnerability, slower organization and response in a kill zone.
    - Higher-communication configuration: 8 of 10 edges present → density = 0.8. Structure: PL communicates with everyone; PSG coordinates rear; L1 (front) talks to L2 and PL; L1 does not talk to L3 or PSG. Consequences: better coordination and faster response.
  - Variations:
    - Weighted density accounts for message volume/intensity (one message vs. multiple messages).
    - Expected density depends on network size: small groups often have higher density; large networks typically have much lower density and more structure (less universal connectivity).

- Implementation note
  - Some basic graph-level measures can be computed by hand; more complex or larger-scale measures are typically computed using software.

- Assignment: calculate degree centrality, closeness centrality, network diameter; infer which node(s) to target for information collection (or capture) based on centrality measures.
- Diameter defined as the longest of the shortest paths (the maximum geodesic length) — the worst-case distance across the network.
- Degree centrality:
  - Construct adjacency matrix (ones and zeros).
  - Sum across each row and divide by (N − 1) (example used N = 10, so denominator = 9).
  - Resulting degree scores visualized as node sizes (noted caution: degree = exposure to the network).
- Betweenness centrality:
  - Enumerate all node pairs and identify all geodesics between them.
  - For a given pair with multiple shortest paths, allocate fractional credit to intermediate nodes (example: pair 1–5 had three geodesics; a node on one of them gets 1/3 ≈ 0.333).
  - Sum contributions for each node; some rows can sum to values > 1 (example row summed to 2).
  - Normalization/denominator used in the example was 10 (per the transcript).
  - Visualization used node size proportional to betweenness.
  - Interpretation: betweenness = informal power / gatekeeping.
- Closeness centrality:
  - Use a distance matrix (entries are shortest-path lengths, not 0/1).
  - Sum distances across a row and divide by the number of other nodes (average distance).
  - Interpretation: closeness = speed/time to reach others; rapid diffusion point.
  - Note: closeness can be undefined or problematic with disconnected components; there are multiple handling approaches.
- Eigenvector centrality:
  - Requires eigen decomposition (mathematically more complex).
  - Identifies nodes connected to other highly connected nodes.
  - Typically computed with software rather than by hand.
- Practical interpretations and heuristics:
  - Degree: reach many people quickly; computationally easy but may not indicate influence.
  - Betweenness: indicates middle-position influence and gatekeeping; often linked to respect/informal power.
  - Closeness: indicates rapid information diffusion potential (average distance).
  - Eigenvector: indicates shared influence via connections to well-connected others.
- Analogy to basic statistics:
  - Mean ≈ closeness (average distance to others).
  - Median ≈ betweenness (being in the middle of paths).
  - Mode ≈ degree (most frequent / most connections).
- Cautions:
  - Degree is often overused because it is easy to compute; not always the best measure in structured or clustered networks.
  - In random/normal-like (blob) graphs, centrality measures can align; in clustered networks they diverge.
  - Disconnected components complicate closeness calculations.
- Exercise workflow: pause to compute metrics by hand on the provided small network, then resume to compare with the worked solution and visualizations.

- Definitions / interpretations
  - Degree: number of edges (direct exposure).
  - Betweenness: extent a node falls on shortest paths between others; indicates ability to gate/broker knowledge and resources between clusters.
  - Closeness: average shortest-path distance to all other nodes; indicates time to hear information and ability to diffuse information rapidly (shorter average distance = faster diffusion).
  - Eigenvector: whether a node is connected to influential others.

- Empirical observations (toy network)
  - Linda has the most connections.
  - Conrad occupies a brokerage position across clusters.
  - Roger has the shortest distance to everybody else.

- Closeness centrality calculation (procedure)
  1. Use a distance matrix of geodesic lengths (not an adjacency matrix). Entries are shortest-path lengths (e.g., agent1→agent5 = 2; agent2→agent4 or agent3 = 2; agent3→agent5 = 3).
  2. For each node, sum the distances to all other nodes (sum across the row).
  3. Divide that sum by (n − 1) to get the average distance.
  4. Invert the average (take reciprocal) so smaller average distances become larger centrality scores (scales similarly to other centrality measures).
  5. Rank nodes by the resulting closeness scores.

- Practical issues / caveats
  - Disconnected nodes or components: distances to unreachable nodes are infinite, making the average distance (and the reciprocal) undefined.
  - Different software/implementations handle infinities differently (some set closeness to zero for unreachable nodes).
  - With multiple components, choices must be made (e.g., compute closeness per-component); pure closeness centrality is well-defined only within a single connected component.
  - When betweenness has already been computed, the geodesic enumeration makes constructing the distance matrix straightforward.

- Outcome
  - Closeness scores are computed from the distance matrix by summing rows, dividing by (n − 1), and inverting; those scores provide a size/ranking of nodes by closeness centrality.

# Summary — Betweenness centrality (concise details)

- Concept and context
  - Betweenness centrality measures the extent to which a node lies on shortest paths (geodesics) between other nodes.
  - Indicates brokerage/gatekeeping/liaison roles: informal power, control of information flow, access to knowledge/resources across clusters.
  - Contrast with other centralities:
    - Degree = number of immediate edges.
    - Closeness = average distance to all others.
    - Eigenvector = connectivity to influential others.
  - Network structure matters:
    - In a single “blob” (homogeneous cluster) degree, closeness, eigenvector are highly correlated.
    - When the network has distinct clusters, betweenness highlights nodes that span clusters and can differ from degree/eigenvector.

- Behavioral/organizational implications
  - Brokers can be strategic (deliberately prevent direct links to protect power) or connective (introduce/hand off links and bring in new resources).
  - Positive outcomes: increased knowledge flow, resource access, organizational growth.
  - Negative outcomes: overload on the broker (high time/cognitive demand), role not rewarded by formal job metrics, potential for toxic gatekeeping.

- Network horizon
  - Awareness of information/skills decays beyond ~3 steps; organizational structure and brokers help locate knowledge in larger networks.

- Calculation procedure (step-by-step)
  - Count all unordered pairs: n choose 2 = n(n−1)/2 (this is the total number of node pairs/possible paths).
  - Enumerate all node pairs and determine geodesics (shortest paths) between each pair.
    - Geodesic may be unique or multiple (multiple shortest paths possible).
  - For each pair, identify middle nodes on the geodesic(s) (endpoints are excluded).
  - For a given node:
    - Numerator = number of shortest paths between other node pairs that pass through that node (if multiple geodesics, count fraction per geodesic).
    - Denominator = number of node pairs excluding the node itself = (n−1 choose 2) = (n−1)(n−2)/2.
  - Scale betweenness to 0–1 for comparability across networks (some software uses 0–100 or raw counts).

- Example details from a 5-node network
  - n = 5 → total unordered pairs = 5 choose 2 = 10.
  - For each node, denominator for betweenness scaling = (5−1 choose 2) = 4 choose 2 = 6.
  - Example geodesic observations:
    - Path 1→4 shortest via 1–3–4 (1–2–3–4 is not a geodesic).
    - Possible multiple geodesics example given: two distinct shortest paths to the same target (e.g., 3→6 via 3–2–6 or 3–1–6).
    - Node 3 appears on many geodesics (example: on 5 geodesics → high betweenness).
    - Nodes on only some geodesics receive fractional contributions (e.g., 0.5 for being on half of the geodesics).
  - Common calculation mistake: failing to count all geodesics when more than one shortest path exists (e.g., pair 2–3 has two geodesics: 2–1–3 and 2–5–3).

- Practical notes
  - Betweenness quantifies informal brokerage but interpretation depends on context (gatekeeping vs connector).
  - Manual practice recommended to master the enumeration and geodesic counting steps.

- Objectives / outcomes
  - Learn social network terminology.
  - Identify types of networks and network topologies.
  - Construct networks from data and represent them as graphs or adjacency matrices.
  - Calculate basic centrality measures by hand and compute graph-level metrics.
  - Understand how adjacency-matrix powers count walks (e.g., A^3 gives number of 3-step walks).

- Basic definitions
  - Graph: set of vertices/nodes and edges/links.
  - Social network: graph where nodes are people and edges are relationships.
  - Node representations can be people, resources, tasks, knowledge, locations, etc.

- Movement and connectivity concepts
  - Step: moving from one vertex to another along a single edge.
  - Walk: a sequence of steps; length = number of steps.
  - Trail: a walk in which all edges are distinct (nodes may repeat).
  - Path: a walk in which all nodes and edges are distinct.
  - Relationship among concepts: every path is a trail; every trail is a walk.
  - Reachable: two nodes are reachable if a path exists between them.
  - Closed walk: a walk that begins and ends at the same node.
  - Cycle: a closed walk of length at least three.

- Representations and notation
  - Graphical depiction: nodes and links visually.
  - Adjacency matrix A: rows and columns correspond to nodes; a_ij = 1 if edge from i to j, else 0 (dichotomous network).
  - A^k: (matrix power) gives counts of k-step walks between nodes.
  - Transpose (A^T): rows ↔ columns; reverses directionality for directed graphs.
  - Summation (Σ) notation used for sums over sets; capital letters for matrices, lowercase a_ij for matrix elements.

- Example application
  - Adjacency matrix used to solve problems such as counting walks (example problem: find adjacency matrix A and number of three-step walks for a given graph).

- Common network topologies and characteristics
  - Core–periphery: small, densely connected core with many peripheral nodes linked to core but not to each other; common in volunteer and religious organizations.
  - Cellular: core plus highly connected cells on the periphery; historically used in covert/insurgent organizations but vulnerable to targeted disruption.
  - Lattice: regular structure where each node has the same degree; highly structured, rarely seen naturally.
  - Erdős–Rényi (random) graph: each pair of nodes connected independently with probability p; high randomness.
  - Small-world: mostly lattice-like with a small number of long-range rewired links; intermediate between lattice and random.
  - Scale-free: degree distribution highly skewed with hubs formed via preferential attachment; examples include airline route maps and social media followings. Mechanisms debated (preferential attachment vs designed/optimized hubs); maintenance costs of relationships limit hub formation in some real contexts.

- Comparisons: traditional (attribute-based) analysis vs network (relational) analysis
  - Focus: individuals/attributes vs structure and relations (dyads/triads).
  - Data: attributes (age, IQ, BMI) vs relational ties (who is connected to whom).
  - Assumptions: independence and identical distribution vs high interdependence among observations.
  - Experimental design: standard control/experiment designs may fail under network dependence; network experiments require different designs.
  - Analytical focus: correlations and individual-level statistics vs network structure measures (clustering, reachability, centrality).
  - Mathematical foundations: calculus/statistics vs graph theory, linear algebra, discrete math.

- Practical notes and implications
  - Calculating centrality and other measures by hand on toy problems helps understand how different software packages compute them and how metrics scale.
  - Relational effects can produce social contagion phenomena (example: obesity shows relational clustering effects).

- Learning objectives and tasks
  - Differentiate four basic network centrality measures: degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector.
  - Calculate degree centrality by hand using an adjacency matrix; practice problems to reinforce mastering the procedure.

- Intuition and examples
  - Visual networks used: a core–periphery network (core actors like agent 285-17-1839) and a “blobby”/less-structured network — both illustrate difficulty of eyeballing who is “most important.”
  - Archetypal Pentagon exercise: merged groups with clusters (upper-right and lower-left). Named actors used as examples: Linda, Roger, Conrad, Red, Sam.
    - Linda: most physical connections (highest degree) within the upper-right cluster.
    - Roger: shortest average distance to all others (highest closeness).
    - Conrad: single bridge between clusters (highest betweenness); his departure caused organizational collapse.
    - Eigenvector centrality highlights nodes in the larger cluster due to random-walk likelihood; correlates with high-degree in that cluster.

- Analogy to mean/median/mode (central tendency)
  - Mean = average (sum ÷ count); useful because of Central Limit Theorem for inference; sensitive to skew.
  - Median = middle value after sorting; robust with skew.
  - Mode = most frequent value; least commonly used.
  - Exercise: construct ten numbers with mean 6, median 5, mode 4 (illustrates different notions of “central”).

- Centrality definitions (concise)
  - Degree: number of edges connected to a node.
  - Betweenness: extent to which a node lies on shortest paths between other nodes.
  - Closeness: inverse of the average shortest-path distance from a node to all others (i.e., average shortest distances).
  - Eigenvector: extent to which a node is connected to influential (highly connected) others; relates to random-walk frequency and PageRank-like behavior.

- Interpretations / uses of each measure
  - Degree: measures exposure and initial reach for information; high-degree nodes spread information widely but may not be persuasive/influential.
  - Betweenness: captures informal brokerage/gatekeeping power; broker positions can be powerful but cognitively draining.
  - Closeness: useful for rapid information diffusion (minimizes time to reach others).
  - Eigenvector: identifies nodes connected to influential others; low-degree but high-eigenvector nodes can be stealthy seeds for rumor/disinformation; simple degree-based detection can miss these.

- Degree centrality calculation (procedure)
  - Build the adjacency matrix A (rows/columns = nodes; A_ij = 1 if i linked to j, else 0).
  - Treat diagonal entries as undefined / ignored (no self-links).
  - Degree centrality for node i: sum of row i in adjacency matrix divided by (N − 1).
    - Formula: degree_centrality(i) = (sum_j A_ij) / (N − 1)
  - Example with N = 5: maximum possible links per node = 4; compute sums across rows and divide by 4 to get normalized degree centralities (e.g., 1/4, 2/4, etc.).
  - Visualization: size nodes proportionally to relative degree to show most-central-by-degree.

- Pedagogical notes
  - Emphasis on practicing hand calculations to master the method.
  - Reminder that different centrality measures answer different questions about “centrality” and should be chosen according to analytic goals (exposure vs. brokerage vs. speed vs. influence).
