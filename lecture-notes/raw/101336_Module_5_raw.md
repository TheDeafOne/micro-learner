Hello, I'm Dr. A Mccullough.
In this module we're
going to be talking about
social theories that go
along with social network analysis.
It's important that we
have one hand on the math
and one hand on the social psychology
of what happens in groups.
It's important because we oftentimes find
that there's counterintuitive
behavior in people.
And we'll make these naive assumptions.
And it's great that we
can go and collect data.
It's great that we can go and
do analytics on the data,
but if we're not informed by
an understanding of what
the right hypotheses are or what are
the right things to look at or not look at.
We oftentimes spinning our wheels
and wasting our time.
It's important that whenever we're practicing
the scientific method that
we observe the world around us.
And that can be
through exploratory data analysis.
It can also be through talking to people.
It can also be through lived experience.
But all of that brings us to the point
of the second step in the scientific method,
which is form a hypothesis.
You have to make that deliberate step,
then go and collect data that is going to
help you do a test to
confirm or deny the hypothesis.
Then we continue, right,
that's the scientific method.
Our objectives today are going to be
described and distinguish
between six social forces.
Understand the right.
If you've heard of Mazo hierarchy of needs,
what's the hierarchy of
social link formation?
I want you to be familiar with
some basic social theories
and social network analysis.
A lot of those have been adapted to online,
a lot of those have been yet to be
proven in online forms.
Because on line is a
little different than face to face,
and we'll talk a little bit about some of
those. Why do we connect?
When we're thinking about why humans connect?
We oftentimes begin with identity theory.
Cooley in 1902 had
this theory called the Looking Glass Self.
He said that people consider
how others perceive them.
They imagine how
others judge that appearance,
and then they develop that sense of
self identity through that
perceived judgment of others.
Well, we now know that what
humans have a little bit
different than most species.
They have something
called von Economoeuronsneurons.
Neurons are actually longer
with fewer dendrites than
the typical neurons we have in the brain.
Not all our neurons are like that.
A lot of the brain neurons are different.
But these von Econome,
they help quickly transmit signals
across our larger brain
or a larger cerebral cortex.
And they're heavily
involved in social processes.
We also know that when we're dealing
with we have something called mirror neurons.
Mirror neurons will look at others.
When other people have expressive emotions,
people have a tendency to mirror
those or adopt those.
Right? It's part of our empathy.
Then as we start to identify with emotions of
those feelings are really in tune to,
to that stimulus, right?
Areas in the area of our brain,
right up here, become active, right?
These are also tied to
our engagement in narratives or stories.
Then it basically just starts working down.
We have this theory of mind, right,
which is usually occurs
at about four or five years old.
Where the classic example is a doll house,
where on one side of the doll house,
it looks like the front of the doll house.
On the back side of the doll house,
you see the dolls.
Well, a kid usually before the age
of four can't understand that.
You, in the front of
the doll house might have
a different perspective than
them in the back of the doll house.
Right?
They don't understand that you can have
different perspectives of looking at things
once that starts happening, right?
There's a particular key
areas of the brain that become
activated when theory of
mind is actually being activated.
And they understand that you might
have a different perspective.
But at base level, we tend to assume that
other people see things the way we do, right?
And this is all tied
into our identity of self.
Erickson is another famous psychologist.
His research showed how
important self worth was,
identity in the core
of human development, right?
Initially, when babies are
born they have like no attachment.
And it's a process
of becoming attached, right,
of learning to be attached to others
in community learning social norms,
and then that's a key piece
of who they are as a person.
Right? We know that from the work of Rogers,
that people need social groups,
tribes, if you will, right?
To validate their sense
of identity, of who they are.
Identity is really at the core of why we
connect and why we
start connecting with other people.
Or you can look at it and say
it's just the biology of the brain
and how we are wired and
getting back to that brain example.
There are a few constraints, right?
Robin Dunbar is an anthropologist,
and what he found was that the size of
social groups for primates is
correlated with the surface area
of their cerebral cortex.
Cerebral cortex is all that like
squishy part of the brain, right?
That's around the
larger cerebral surface area
is the more people in a primary group.
For humans that is
about 150 people in a primary social group.
Now what we know is when
you have an organization
that has about 150 people or less,
it's quite possible for you to
know everybody's name
in that organization, right?
Like I was a company commander in the army.
I think the largest we had was about 180,
but most of the time it was
around 160 soldiers.
And I knew pretty much
everybody's name in that company.
Right when I saw them, I knew who they were.
And then I had this mental map
of where they fit in the organization,
what their skills were, what they could do.
When you start getting organizations
that are beyond 150,
it becomes very difficult
to know everybody's name.
It becomes very difficult to know what
everybody's
skills and those sorts of things are.
And this is where we need to start applying
like organizational structure
to help us navigate
larger organizations, right?
That's tied to
that mental capacity for us understanding it.
Now, Kill Bernard.
They were doing a series of
studies on respondent accuracy, right?
Like is there when you ask people questions,
how good are they at actually
reporting the truth, right?
Old statement says people
lie but brains don't like.
That's the whole argument for neural imaging.
Bernard and Kilby did number of studies on
respondent accuracy and doing
a secondary analysis for
secondary pass, right?
They went through and said
how many people can somebody recall?
And they estimated that
to be about 231 on average,
with a max person being about 290 people.
Now I have to
say that when you're doing that,
you're giving people like
memory cues as you're trying
to help improve the accuracy of
people that might be a little bit larger.
My point in this is just that there is
some debate over what that number is, right?
What is the number that a person can
actually have as
a primary group of social friends?
But the actual value
of the number difference,
but what's fairly agreed
upon is that there is a limit.
Now one of the things that I like to do,
I like to ask people in person class,
how many friends or how
many meaningful
conversations did you have today?
And I can ask you that question.
You can think about that
for a moment if you want to,
if you want to pause and think about it.
But the finding that I get,
a person is like a software
developer and I would
used to teach in the evenings around 637,
whatever that second time slot was.
What I would find is,
if you're a software developer,
high single digit numbers,
you might say six to eight.
And what I mean by a meaningful conversation,
it's not just like, hey, how are you?
But it's like you actually
talked about something, right?
It could be the football game last night,
it could be what you're doing this weekend,
It could be something that's
going on with your kids.
But you talked about
something like six to eight.
If you were a person that was
involved in more like
business development or management,
that number would get maybe
15 to 20 meaningful conversations.
Right Then if I'd say,
how many friends do you have on Facebook now?
I know people are probably
now more on like Instagram,
Twitter, and other things.
When we would say Facebook,
we would find that a person that was fairly
young might have like 4500 connections.
A person that had gone
through high school college and
now was graduated might be over 1,000 Right,
We find what's the difference between
the eight to ten conversations
that you've had.
Like how many people do
you consider friends in
a social group versus like
1,000 people that would be on Facebook.
What we find is that when
there's no constraint right
on when there's a constraint
on the number of people you
can physically talk to or the number of
people you can keep in
a primary social group.
It actually then changes
the structure of the social network.
Then when you're on line and you can have
one link and there's
no further maintenance required,
right, for that kind of relationship.
Maheu and Levenger, Well,
before social media thought
about this, right, in 1976,
they said things that
would affect the constraints on
relationships in a social network
might be the nature of the relationship.
For us in our day, it would be like,
is it an online, is it an acquaintance,
is it a face to face meeting,
is it a meaningful conversation?
That nature of the relationship
will change the structure of the network.
How much time investment is required
to really consider it a relationship,
And what are
the cognitive limitations of the actors.
Some people have a better mental capacity
to have more friends than others.
And I think the actual reasons why
are not as interesting to
me and probably not as well understood.
But the fact that people are
different is
something we need to keep in mind.
All right, these are
thinking about why we connect.
Now there is a theory
that people have different innate strategies
in how they are going to
maximize their networks, right?
So many people, some people
are going to have many low value ties, right?
So they're going to
have a lot of acquaintances.
Other people are going to focus
on their time and energy on having
a few high value relationships
that are more intense.
Some people diversify across social groups.
What I mean by social groups, people
have a social circle, right?
You think you're like your church,
You could think of your family,
you could think of work circles, right?
A person is not just in one social circle,
they're in many social circles
and they're going to sit at
the intersection of those.
We call each of these circles
a focus or a social object.
Some people are going to diversify
across social groups.
They're going to try
and choose friends that have,
that satisfy different aspects
of their personality, right?
Like I'm going to have my church friends and
my work friends and
they're going to be very different.
Right. Like my son is a data scientist in
DC and he likes to skateboard.
His friends that he spends time with Right,
doing skateboarding, probably none of them
interact with his friends at work that
are doing data science and doing stuff.
He used to work for the State Department.
I think he's now working
for Defense Logistics Agency.
Those social groups are disparate,
right, and very disconnected.
And he has got a very small intersection.
Other people like me,
I tend to have most of
my friends or people that I
worked with before or
when I was in the army, right?
Everybody that I was friends with
were also in the army, right?
There's a huge overlap,
just different strategies that people have.
It's not necessarily deliberate, it can be,
you don't even think about it, but these are
just things that people do.
Some people have resource heterophile
deliberately make friends
of different backgrounds so
that they can have
access to different resources.
While as other people are going to reinforce
their identity by having more and
more people that are similar to them,
they're going to choose to, some people
find social circles specifically for love,
friendship, security, and belonging, right?
That's a lot of times like
church groups or family groups,
employment becomes a common social circle.
And then any hobbies or activities you do,
right, being in that social circle
allows you then to
do the hobby that you want to do, right?
Like if I want to go scuba
diving, who has the boat?
Who has the gear? Right? I need
a buddy when I go, right.
Like I need kind of a community
to be able to really
engage in those hobbies, right?
Same thing for like rock climbing, right?
Who's going to lay you if
you're rock climbing, right?
You need to have groups or
communities for that, right?
So these are different reasons why
people might join different social circles.
Changing gears a little bit.
I want to talk about social exchange theory.
So I found this really fascinating.
And I'll just give you a quick example
here with the slide, right?
Social exchange theory games.
The best way to explain it is
think of like Oreos and milk, right?
If you have a bunch of Oreos,
right, you haven't got milk moment, right?
Like there's no milk to wash it down.
It's no good to have
five Oreos and no milk, right?
On the other hand, it's not good
to have like a big glass of milk.
But you have no Oreos, right?
Because everybody wants the Oreos.
If one person has milk
and the other person has Oreos,
right,
the person milk will give some of their milk.
The guy with the Oreos, the Oreo guy,
will give some of the cookies
to the milk guy, right?
That's social exchange, right?
They've exchanged goods so
that now everybody has
an even number of units,
right? Of these things.
When you start looking at
social exchange games, right?
You might put people into
a network, they can trade.
That doesn't have to be Oreos and milk.
It can be money, units
can be a lot of different things, right?
When you have two mode networks,
like a two node network here,
what you find is that on average,
people are going to trade
evenly so that everybody,
both A and B,
have the same relative quantities
of oreos and milk.
Right? That's generally the way that
works when you see a three network, right,
like you see here with D and E.
The person D in the middle is in
a unique position where they can broker,
E and C can't trade with each other.
D becomes richer.
D ends up having more Oreos and milk
because they can extort a price out of that.
When you go to the four node network, right?
And you start looking at that one,
here's the most fascinating one for me.
When people are blind to the network,
right, people don't know their position.
What we find is that H and I will trade,
G and F will trade and there will be
very little trade between
the H I group and the GF group.
But when you show people their network,
then G and H trade
heavily and they extort their position,
they get way more of the resources.
What do I mean by that is, you know,
I'm going to, you know,
if you have ten units and I have
ten units right at the end of this game,
you might have like one or two units.
And I'm going to have like 18 like if I'm H,
because they're going to
take advantage of their position.
And the degree of
which those resources get
exchanged is heavily correlated with,
between the centrality in the network, right?
So based on their, between the centrality
will be a pretty good indicator
of the degree to which
that resources are going to be traded, right?
There's a whole set of research on
social exchange theory and we're not going to
take time in this course
to get fully into it,
I'm just giving you a taste.
But we know that reciprocity
compels social exchange, right?
This is like when you go
to car dealership and they give you free,
so they give you something, right?
Then you have this Nate feeling
that you've got to reciprocate and buy a car.
And it seems a little absurd that buying you
a soda is going to increase
your likelihood of buying a car.
But research has shown
that, that actually happens, right?
There's reciprocity compel social exchange.
There's this motivation of exchange
of benefits is a reason why
people come into relationships
and why they interact.
A lot of it's linked to power
like I was just describing,
and that position in the network
allows an unequal distribution of benefits.
I think
social exchange theory is quite fascinating.
We're now going to get into
the six social forces.
The first one being homophile.
Homophily is birds of
a feather flock together.
Basically, people that are
similar to each other
are more likely to enter
into relationships and be connected.
The specific attributes for what
you're similar across is not defined.
I believe in a theory
of perceived similarity.
This is where awfully can be asymmetric.
A lot of times I think of
an example of when I was
first teaching at West Point,
we just completed grad school.
A bunch of officers, there's like 30 of
us that come into an academic department,
and we're supposed to be assigned
together for the next three years.
Teaching math, make your friends,
you don't know anybody on this post,
you're figuring
out who you're going to be friends with.
There were two guys that I felt
were somewhat similar to me.
That we had the same teams in football.
We had kids the same age,
we had similar unit background, right?
You know, all of us were married.
You know, I thought, hey, these guys
are cool so I'll hang out with them.
Well, you know, 23 months into living there,
I eventually learned that they're having
barbecues at each other's house
and I'm not invited,
so you can feel sad for me.
Right. I was like excluded and it was sad.
I remember praying for a year
that God would give me a friend. Right?
So it was like a very lonely time.
But after that year,
my best friend arrived,
right? He became my best friend.
And after a few months,
those other two guys were
inviting him to their house.
And I'm still not invited,
but my friend ended
up wanting to hang out
with me a little bit more.
So then I still had a friend.
Right. What I
haven't told you all that story.
That last friend, by
the way, is Tony Johnson,
who many of you might
know in the program since he's like
the program director for graduate programs.
But all
of those three guys were African American.
The first two guys, good guys or whatever,
But being African American
was like a huge part of their identity.
I'm seeing us as being
similar on the basis
of we have kids the same age,
we have the same interest in football,
same experiences in the military.
That's what's drawing me
when they're looking at me.
I'm not African American,
like they don't
perceive me as similar to them.
When Tony arrives, Right.
If you were to say like what's
probably his identity,
Obviously he is African American,
but that's not like top of the
list of his identity,
he might be, say he's a
Christian and he's a father
and he's a soldier, right?
Like there's a lot of things that come down
as to who he is before
you get to that definition of
African American in his calculus, right?
He felt more similar to me
or felt that I was more similar
to him than the other two, guys.
The other two guys work.
That's where people can have
asymmetric homophile or connections.
And that makes networks
very interesting in terms of how that is.
You can also do research
questions to ask people.
We use cultural domain analysis,
which would be to ask somebody.
Think of somebody in
your community you admire.
Picture them in your mind.
Now, describe for me their characteristics.
What else? What else?
What else you need
All these free list questions.
Well, the earlier you list it,
the more common across respondents,
the more salient it is.
And you can actually use
the salience equation to calculate
the level of salience for
these different attributes of
people are admirable.
Now, when you do that, you can also say,
when you think of yourself, what type
of characteristics would you describe?
Right? And you ask people to do that.
Now you can do almost like
a spearman correlation, if you will,
on how you perceive
yourself versus your perception
of others in a group.
And it will help you identify
metrics to quantify
how a person might be gravitating
towards one group versus another, right?
That's how homo works, also dynamic.
When you start spending
more time with people,
you begin to understand, well,
I thought they were like this,
but really they're like that, right?
As you get more information,
you might spend less time
with somebody or more time with somebody.
As you get more information
and you understand it.
Homophile can be dynamic as
we learn more about
the people we're in community with.
I did do a study at West Point
over six years where there's
a particular graduate program
that would be done on West Point
through Columbia University Officers,
25 to 30 officers would all of a
sudden show up through
a one year graduate program together.
And then they would be
tactical officers which are
responsible for training
discipline at West Point.
So I did that over six years.
It allowed you to see the way
the dynamics of how friendships
formed over time.
What I would do is I would give
them blackberries in
exchange for being in my experiment.
And then they would do a weekly survey.
I could look at, see who they
were e mailing, who they were calling,
and who they would
report face to face friendships with.
We could see that it allowed
us to look at the conditions of forming,
Norming, how friendship formation evolved,
which is where we get the hierarchy
of friendship formation from.
What was really interesting
is in the first five weeks,
the most significant factor
drawing people together, it was always race.
But then after about five weeks,
as that dynamic homophile changed,
it became religion just
for context, on a military base.
I don't think it's like Catholics
and Protestants going at it.
Right? It's not like sectarian violence,
but the way posts are organized is there will
be a Catholic chapel
and there'll be a Protestant chapel.
So what we found was that,
you know that if you're in your work right,
your class or whatever,
this group you're trying
to figure out who
you're going to be friends with.
And then you go to church and you recognize
somebody that you work with.
Oh, well that's a point of homophily, right?
That's a point of similarity.
They tended to be more likely
to gravitate towards that person,
then they go back to work and they're like,
oh, those are the people
that I went to church with.
Right? And these are how
the groups started to form.
And so there was a Catholic group,
there was a Protestant group,
and then there was others, right?
So the people that didn't have
that reinforcing example
from going to church,
they kind of became a group together.
The other thing I should point out that at
West Point is an interesting example,
because the base is about 2 miles wide,
2 miles by 2 miles,
And everybody lives there and everybody works
there and all their kids
go to the same school.
And you have to live on post unless
there's like a real exception
that you've qualified for,
you go immediately off the base, right?
It is not the best part of New York, right?
Highland Falls is not exactly a great area,
you tend to not really hang
out with people or get to know people there.
It's a very insular community
and it's like an hour from New York City.
You're in this weird little island,
made for a great experimental group,
right, to understand how
of work for friendship formation.
Next, social force is reciprocity.
We talked a little bit about this, right?
Which is if I give you something,
you're compelled to
give me something in return.
I scratch your back, you scratch mine.
It lowers the cost for establishing links.
If somebody is making
the effort to reach out to me,
then it's easier for me to reciprocate and
reach out to them as opposed
to have a net new friend.
Right? The lack of
reciprocity can lead to lost links.
If people are making
an effort and you're not responding,
you're not fulfilling that social obligation,
then they're not going to want to keep making
that effort and it's going to
lead to a loss link.
It's inefficient to keep
spending energy and links
that don't pay off basically.
Negative relationships can also
develop reciprocal negative relationships,
right?
Like if person a is mean to person,
person B is more likely to be
mean back to person a, right?
That's also another aspect of reciprocity.
This has been part one of social theories.
I look forward to joining you in
part two to continue this lecture.

Hello, I'm Dr. Ian Mccullough and
this is part two in social Theories.
In part one, we introduce some
of the foundational research
and theories in social psychology that
underpins social network analysis.
We also introduced the first
two of six social forces.
We will now be picking up with
the third social force in this lecture.
Proximity. People that are
near each other are going to be more
likely to form connections
than people that are farther apart.
And that can be in physical space
or organizational space, right?
When you're in the same unit
or in an organization,
you might be in the same meetings together.
You're sitting there waiting
for the meeting to start.
You have more chance to
talk and interact, right?
Just gives more opportunities to meet.
What you're seeing here on
the right is something called semantic space.
You see that there's an office space in
the upper left and
right here, these office ******.
Lines drawn across them.
And the lines are
looking at like where you can actually
see or move through
the actual physical space.
What we know is
that physical distance, right?
The Euclidean distance of how far people
are apart or even
how many steps they have to walk,
is not a person's
cognitive perception of space.
It's actually more visually attuned, right?
We did this study where we looked at
offices, four different offices,
and we were able to construct
the semantic ****** you're seeing
here where if there is
a place to move from one spot to the other,
we're going to create that as a segment.
So that's a movement without turning.
And so you can see that we
have in the upper left there,
BCD, where you see that.
You see how that is drawn and abstracted.
Then each of those line
segments become a node,
and then we can actually
construct a network of
the semantic space of
a physical office or location.
Okay, what we found is
there's different ways of measuring distance.
And the ones that were
actually the most significant in
an open office plan is
actually the angle in which you have to
move your head if you're
sitting such that you see all of
the cubicles or all of the people
in an open office plan in front of you.
You're going to be at a positional advantage
than if you're positioned right
behind them looking out the window
and you don't see everybody.
The person that has greater visibility
in line of sight to people is
going to be more proximal in an organ in
an open office and is
going to likely be more connected.
But the way this works is we think
it just gives people more opportunities
or interaction for discovery.
When people are on your mind
and you're thinking about them,
you're more likely to go over and reach
out to them and
collaborate and talk about something.
Then it creates more interaction.
When you're designing offices,
you have to think about what
is the function that
you're actually doing in this office?
If the purpose of being in the office is to
be collaborative and innovative, right?
And to have people kicking around ideas and
trying to do every project
you're doing is one
off and is very different.
You need to have a lot of creative energy
then an open office plan is great.
But if you're like a software company
and you're trying to get people
to just code their module on their software,
update it, then that might be more difficult.
And you might want to have more cubicles or
more separation so that
people can stay focused on their work.
If you have cubicles in an office space,
the reason for doing that
would probably be because you want
people to have the ability to
get up and go get help
if they need to from a person.
If they can't do it on
a chat forum for some reason.
Or you want to just make sure that they're
actually working and that they're not like,
you know, sandbagging and doing like
a half job from
home or something like that. Right?
So these would become very
interesting as we've coming out
of the aftermath of Covid and thinking
about these hybrid models
of work from home, work in an office.
What does that mean? What are the strengths?
So hopefully, proximity can give you
some idea of thoughts for what's going on.
In terms of the collaborative aspect of that,
I did do a study
that I thought would be interesting to
share at AP L, the Applied Physics lab.
So what you see in the upper left
is the intelligence system center.
It was a temporary building for
a particular group in
the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab.
What had happened is in
the three different groups
focused on neuroscience,
one focused on robotics,
and one focused on machine learning.
And AI were merged
together into a single group.
They were initially placed in
the office structure you see in
the bottom left, which is.
A traditional two people per office, right?
A few conference rooms area.
And we were able to see how
friendship formation or work formations
were changed in this office type scenario.
What I mean by that is we had access
to the data exhaust
from the E mail exchange server.
So we could see who's e mailing who.
We had a lot
of instrumentations like we would
have microphones that would help
us anonymize the specific conversations,
but it would give us an idea
of how many people were there.
Because we could estimate based
on the noise that was going on in there.
We could look at little mats on the floor to
see how different areas of
hallway were being transited.
Right, there's a lot of
instrumentation in these places,
but we were able to see how
the network evolved when
it was two people per office,
then they were moved into
this facility that you see in the middle.
It's maybe hard to see what you look
is there are some places
that are more traditional,
that are more traditional
office type structures.
But a lot of it was like open office plans,
open cubicles, some of them had
like little phone booths
for more private conversations.
But if there was like
a different office space,
you could imagine at that time it was in
the space and they just let
people freely go where they wanted to go.
And then we continued to
monitor how the network formed.
The results of this study
then inform the building
of the construction of
an $82 million building
on the Applied Physics Lab campus.
If you're familiar with APL,
there's like the main gate to
APL across the street.
There's, I think,
two or three buildings there.
The taller one was the one
that was built based on this.
I think they actually threw away the findings
from the study when they
actually did the final building.
I'm not sure how much it approved,
but it was still a pretty cool study to do.
We were able to look at
people's reported satisfaction,
productivity, collaboration.
The total data collection occurred over
an 18 month period of time.
We were able to do a match sample,
so we were able to look at
the same group of people in
different physical ****** to
see how they interacted.
We were able to talk
about perceived benefits,
like their perceptions of collaboration,
awareness and shared space.
Some of the drawbacks
they reported was distraction,
no privacy and noise.
Right when they're in an open office place,
we were able to measure, to some degree,
space utilization
and productivity and collaboration.
All of those are a little more difficult.
Then as I mentioned,
we had like noise, how
people were moving the space.
We had e mail networks
to see their structure.
Some of the things we found was
when you move to an open office plan,
there tends to be less toxic leadership.
There's a certain amount of privacy
required to be toxic.
You see increased collaboration for people
that are sitting in occupying
****** within about 20 meters of each other.
Once you start getting
open office plans greater than 20 meters.
We've replicated this in other studies.
You don't find the collaborative benefit.
We've been able to
measure positional advantage.
Based on what you can see,
there are some adverse impacts
on women in open office ******.
Women feel greater pressure
to get ready to dress up the way they act,
the way they look, stuff like that.
Find that open office plans
actually disadvantage women.
That's not me saying that,
that is a woman scientist architect
that has pointed that out.
There's a lot of increased distraction.
And there's
also a need for collaborative space.
You can't just have people
sitting in open office ******.
You need to have places where they
can meet and
they can actually talk and
work to get the benefits of that.
Otherwise,
you're only getting the distraction.
You're not getting the benefits.
That's this concept of space and how it
affects social link
formation and social networks.
Prestige, Prestige is a social force
that is about status, Ta, if you will.
How important a person is.
The first thing I would say
is it's culturally dependent.
It's typically somebody who
epitomizes cultural norms and more.
Right. In the military,
a lot of it is based on
how many badges you have,
like are you a ranger, are you a paratrooper?
How many times have you gone to combat?
Like there's a, there's this set of
metrics that make you an
amazing person in the military, right?
Which is different than
if you're on an NFL sports team.
Who cares if you're in
the military or how long you went there?
Right there, it's like,
you know, what are your sports status, right?
How often do you catching the ball,
how far are you throwing the ball?
Have you been to the Super Bowl?
You know, there's a whole different set of
metrics which is going to be very
different than if you're an academic, right?
It's how many academic
publications have you done,
how many research grants have you earned?
How many Phd students have you produced?
Right? So every walk of
life has a different set of
metrics that is going to
contribute to prestige
within that cultural context.
We know that prestige can be lost and
people don't like their prestige being lost.
They are going to take actions to
maintain and guard against
that and maintain their prestige.
It can also depend on associations.
If you're associating with
somebody that has lower prestige,
that can threaten the perception
of prestige you have
within that social group.
And it tends to have people that are
more prestigious within a cultural context.
Associating with each other's not people of
lower status that exists.
That ties into that homophile bit.
And that's where you can see that some of
these aren't cleanly different,
but there is
a little bit of overlap between them.
Now that second last statement,
I use that in classes
just to spark discussion.
And I probably should have
taken it off the slide here,
but that's actually not true.
Men don't have a greater desire for prestige,
but it's meant to get you a
little bit irritated and thinking about it.
Men and women tend to
have different drivers for prestige.
And then you can argue whether that's
cultural, biological, or whatever.
But what we find in Western society,
at the very least,
is that men tend to have a greater drive
for prestigious status as
defined by their work,
by their relationship with their wife.
Whereas women tend to have greater drive
for primary relationship with
their spouse and relationship
and the status of their kids.
Women tend to be a lot more
focused on how the kids
are doing those activities.
Men tend to be focused a lot on work.
Again, I just point out that you can
argue whether that's culturally derived,
whether that's biological,
and there's like debate
on both of those sides,
which I'm sure you've heard before.
I think it's just interesting that
there are different aspects of culture,
of community, of context,
of gender, of all
of these things that play together.
And it creates a great field
for potential research topics
because our society has changed so
much over the last ten years,
let alone 50 years.
There's always room to replicate some
of these studies and
look at it a little bit more.
One of my favorite projects
was from Dan Held,
and he's a professor
at University of Kentucky.
He did when he was a graduate student,
a wrapper disc network.
This is where he looked at rap music.
A disc is where one wrapper
disrespects another in a song.
That's a disc so he can make
a directed link from one wrapper to the next.
Then he looked at the networks over
time of discs in music.
Then he correlated that with record sales.
He was able to make
a argument that prestige could
be measured by the volume
of record sales that you had actually had.
He was able to find some very interesting,
some counterintuitive findings, right?
For example, generally speaking,
if you're disrespected, your
status goes down, right?
But if you respond effectively to that disc,
your status can go up.
But then if you
are a big wrapper and
you disc a little wrapper,
right, Instead of the little wrappers status
going down because they're noticed,
it actually is elevated, right?
If you're a little wrapper
and you disc a bigger wrapper,
it doesn't really have much movement
or effect at all, right?
But if you're responded to,
your status goes up quite a bit.
If you're a big wrapper and
you actually respond to a little wrapper,
your status instead of
you defending your reputation.
It actually goes down because you
acknowledge the little wrapper,
right, when you're looking
at some of those dynamics.
It's a fun, silly paper,
but it was just a fascinating exploration
on how prestige is a little bit
more complex than it sounds at
first when we talk
about social conformity, right?
This is just an important thing
for context, right?
You may have heard me talk about the example
of this famous experiment from Solomon Ash,
where he would show people in a room, right,
see people sitting in a room,
three lines, A, B, and C.
And then he would show this
other line here to the left,
and say, what is the length of that line?
Is it A, B, or C?
The trick of the experiment
is most of the subjects
were confederates of the experiment
and would agree to give a wrong answer.
On most of the trials, only one guy,
the guy in the white shirt there,
second from the right is
the actual subject in the experiment.
When people are not answering C,
but they go right.
What does that guy do? Well, what
Solomon Ash found is that
That person would conform
to the group in an obviously wrong answer.
On about 37% of the critical trials,
he also found that they responded
for different reasons, right?
Some people responded,
they assume that everybody
else must be right,
they must be wrong, right?
That was about a third of the subjects,
a little over 12,
13% of the responses, right?
So they just thought everybody
else must be right and they must be wrong.
We call that informational conformity.
The rest just didn't
want to go against the group pressure.
They knew that they were wrong,
but they just didn't
want to feel uncomfortable
and be the only one that was setting it out.
And that's what we call normative conformity,
where they're conforming to
the norms of the groups.
He could explain about 37% of the trials.
When I was teaching that, once
I did in a class,
one of my students was like, that's
the coolest thing I've ever seen
I'm going to totally do that.
I'm like, what do you mean he's like,
he's like,
I'm a Platoon Sergeant
in the United States Army.
I'm going to do that tomorrow And I'm like,
you can't just do that on
your platoon He goes, yeah,
I can't I'm like,
there's ethics in research,
there's IRB's, you don't
understand, it's happening tomorrow.
I'm like, okay, well at least make it good.
He had a social network from
the previous semester of the people in
the platoon we were able to ask,
they have to ask them either
who they spent time with,
who their friends were, or
who they respected.
We had these two networks.
These, the nodes are now
sized by their relative rank.
Then we were able to select
green nodes being central
and red notes being peripheral.
If you look at a couple
of those green notes and say,
well, you don't look that central,
that's probably
because they were very central
in the other network and we weren't sure
which one was most
important rather than do
the lengths of lines
because that would be weird.
Is we did military trivia because in
the military you get
promotion points for different activities.
One of those activities
is your military knowledge.
People would oftentimes study or practice
for those promotion boards
so they could do well.
We took some of those questions,
This was my favorite, right?
When is a tourniquet applied to a neck wound?
If you're not laughing at that,
you either don't know what
a tourniquet is or you're not attending to
it because that's pretty funny, right?
But like questions like this,
you would say will they conform.
What we found was
that what we found
was that the people that
were central to the network,
in this particular case of 15 questions,
one guy conformed twice,
but all of the others were
zero compared with the red.
They conformed on an average of
13 to 15 of the questions.
Right. Between those responses,
what we find is that people on the peripheral
of the network much more
likely to conform to group norms to gain
acceptance than people that
are central to the network.
They have a little bit more freedom and
a little more security in the group to be
able to say something different.
This is of course
replicated on other platoons.
There's a publication that I think
in your reading you can
take a look at on that.
This is like how social
networks are actually even
moderating that social conformity.
Just some of those stats, right?
The network conformity was correlated with,
between the centrality with
about a negative 0.84 meaning
that people that are
central don't need to conform.
People that are peripheral do.
Okay. It also is
a significant factor in
post traumatic stress disorder.
I studied an infantry brigade
prior to their deployment to Afghanistan.
We did full psychometric evaluations
about before their deployment,
two to three months into their
deployment and post deployment.
So we could study the onset of,
of PTSD, depression,
and unfortunately suicide.
We found that people that
were on the periphery
of the social network that
didn't get acceptance were
the most likely to develop depression,
PTSD, and suicidal ideation.
It's not a lot
of people think of it as
like a moral weakness,
but we're like biologically
wired in our brains,
in our biology to seek
social connection and
to seek social acceptance.
I would argue before Mazal,
hierarchy of needs, people have
a need for purpose, acceptance, and control.
Now, Milgram did
another series of experiments.
Now Stanley Milgram, you might have heard
of him from the movie The Experimenter.
He was one of Solomon Ash's students.
And then he did a famous series
of experiments where he asked
people to commit a moral acts when
an authority figure was
responsible for it, right?
A Dr. in a white lab
coat is going to ask them to
administer lethal shocks to people.
And he found that about 65% of
people would actually do that when
the authority figure is responsible.
So we know that prestige
and centrality increases
opinion leadership over the normative group.
Right? So he could get up to 65% I
would argue that the understanding
the position in the network
can help us explain
about 85% of conformity.
We're going to move on to
the fifth social force which is transitivity.
This is simply if
one person knows two others,
they're more likely to form
a relationship, right? That's transitivity.
You can mathematically calculate transitivity
on a little three no triad there.
Which is basically when you take
an adjacency matrix and
you multiply it by itself,
you get the same adjacency matrix.
Right? Like a squared equals a
is the definition
mathematically of transitivity.
Some disagreement on how you calculate
transitive activity and
social network analysis.
One of the more common ways that seems
to work a little bit better empirically,
is geometrically,
we edgewise shared partners.
What that's saying is if
two people have one friend
in common, they're more likely to meet.
Right? If two people
have a few friends in common,
they're even more likely to meet.
If two people have like 30 friends
in common and they haven't met,
there's probably a reason for it.
What the Wisp does for
every increasing person that
you share in common,
you're more likely to meet.
But it has a diminishing marginal return,
right?
That's geometrically weighted.
It fades off so that when you start adding
more and more people
doesn't really affect it.
Then we set that parameter for that shape,
for how well the degree
to which it's going to decay.
And you can fit that to data so you get
a better understanding of how transitivity
is actually working in a group.
When we look at trans, we
think of it in terms of a triad.
And you'll see that there are
16 different types of triad that you can,
you can have as you
see over here on the right.
Some of those networks
have transitive properties, right?
Like the ones you see
six through nine, for example,
14.16 right, are all examples of
transitive triads because they're
completing the triangle, if you will.
That allows us to look into
a network structure and
we're able to measure,
okay, this node is
occupying a transitive triad.
Now we can statistically say,
are links more likely to form
such that they complete transitivity or not?
And so that is a way we can statistically
test that when we get in the network
statistics part of the course.
Okay, The last social force we're
going to talk about is balance theory,
and I'm going to use this as an example.
Balance theory is basically saying,
a friend of my friend is my friend,
a friend of my enemies, my enemy.
The enemy of my enemy is my friend, right?
So it assumes that relationships
can either be positive or negative.
I'll use an example.
This is an old example we've
used to help people
understand the complexity of
tribal dynamics in Afghanistan.
If you're an Afghan, right,
you might have affinity
towards the United States forces.
You might have affinity to the Taliban.
What do I mean by that?
Well, hey, there's a lot
to like about the US, right?
You have security, economic development,
you have educational opportunities.
But for the Taliban, you have shared culture,
shared religion, shared values, right?
So there's a lot that you like there.
Clearly the US and the
Taliban do not like each other.
911, Right? It's not balanced.
If you're an Afghan, you have
this cognitive dissonance where every time
you're spending positive energy or
positive relationships with the US for
the economic development opportunities,
you're worried about what's
the Taliban going to do to you?
What are they going to think? Likewise, if
you spend positive time,
you're giving food and clothing, whatever,
to the Taliban, then you
got to be worried that the US are going
to implicate you in some being
a Taliban sympathizer and throw you in jail.
Huge cognitive dissonance and I use
this conflict example
because it's a little more extreme.
But the reality is Afghan
is not one group, right?
There's many. There might be Pashtun and
Hazara as like two very popular tribes.
Pashtun and Hazara don't
particularly like each other,
nor does the US and the Taliban.
Then when the US reaches out to the Pashtoun,
right, and starts being positive to them.
What happens then with this relationship To
the Huzzah friend of
my enemy Becomes my enemy
and that becomes a negative relationship.
Now when we're looking at how
did the Huzzar feel about the Taliban.
Well then it becomes positive, right?
Then how do we end up dealing
with the past and the Taliban, right?
That becomes also a negative tie, right?
This is the social force from balance theory.
If you actually want to
achieve any improvement in that,
you may have to target the relationship
between the past and Huzzarlpm.
Reverse that negative feelings,
help them feel.
Like they're of one people.
So that you're breaking up that tension.
But of course then when you
have now a consolidated group,
it's not clear that they're going to
necessarily ally with the US.
They could also ally
with the Taliban as well.
So they could go one way or another
so they could backfire, right?
But that's what we're thinking about
when we're dealing with balance theory.
Now, if balanced theory was
the only social force,
people would bifurcate
into two distinct groups.
And to the extent to which
the other social forces become master,
minimized and
balanced theory becomes stronger.
That happens, right? We see
that in politics today too.
Where you have, you know,
two different political parties.
You actually find because of balanced theory,
that if you have multiple political parties,
like people say like,
why do we have a two party system?
Why can't we have more parties?
Well, there are countries
that have multiple parties.
What ends up happening
is when they get into office,
in order to get any other legislation passed,
they form into blocks
or coalitions of parties.
And then what ends up happening is
you might have your issue
like you might care about,
I don't know, like economic reform, right?
Another person might care about
criminal justice reform.
Well, if you want to get
your criminal justice stuff passed,
you need the help of these people on
the economic reform to be on your site.
You'll figure the biggest block there.
And you'll say, if you vote for my issue,
I'll vote for your issue.
Now, there can be
no dissension because if anybody
votes their conscience instead
of their party's position,
well then then they're going to lose
the support of the other party
for the bigger gain.
What ends up happening is
when you have multiple parties,
you actually find that nobody
is able to vote their conscience.
When there's a two party system,
people are actually much more free to vote
their conscience and break from
party lines
as far as how they're going to do that.
But when balanced theory becomes
the only force, then my group,
my political party becomes
my homophile becomes
my prestige becomes my proximity
becomes all of these overlapping things,
and it becomes very bifurcated.
When we think about balanced or imbalanced,
a balanced network occurs when
the multiplication of a triad
leads a positive relationship.
What we're showing here in the table
is there's a relationship
between node 1.2 node 1.3 node 2.3 right?
Those are the three relationships.
You see that if you have positive,
positive, positive, that's balanced.
But when you have positive,
positive, negative,
right, that negative relationship
becomes imbalanced, right?
Because if you multiply them
across their negative right,
the social groups are going to
tend towards balanced relationships.
The only reason why you will have
imbalanced relationship is because there's
other social forces that
are keeping those triads imbalanced.
This has been a lecture on
social theories, part two.
We've covered the six social forces,
the last four in this particular lecture.

I'm
Dr. An Mccullough.
This is our third and final part
of our lectures on social theories.
Social theories are very
important for understanding
the social psychological foundation
of social network analysis.
There's a few other act
optimization strategies
that we haven't really discussed much, right?
Structural holes is this idea
that if you remember that network we did
from crack when we were
looking at centrality and there was
like two clusters in
the network and there was
Conrad in between them, right?
Well, that's an example
of structural holes where there's a hole.
The only guy, there's
no other relationships between
the cluster in the upper right and
the cluster in the lower left, right?
There's no cross ties there.
So that's an example of what
we call a structural hole.
It occurs when there's a sole broker
between the different social objects.
Those people have high informal power.
It's cognitively demanding.
Others naturally seek
to develop redundant ties.
A lot of times effort formation needs to
be expended to prevent that from happening.
That's a really interesting property
in terms of how networks,
instead of it being
necessarily was a positive thing,
that hey, there's this great broker.
It might be a negative thing that there are
structural holes that haven't
been created a lot of times.
You can break structural holes
by having office groups,
social events, or we
did this study at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
We found that there was a problem
with infusion pumps.
That's the thing that the IV system,
you get the infusion pump when you
get checked into the hospital
and then it moves with the patient.
There's certain areas of
the hospital that have high demand.
They need them for the incoming patients.
And then there's a different part of
the hospital that's releasing them.
They have a bunch of excess.
Initially, we put RFID tags on there so
we could track where they were and have
or go move them.
But then we were able to look
at how departments were connected
and identify structural holes
between different departments in a hospital.
For example, oncology is a
little bit off on its own
from As is 0 B
than a lot of the other hospital units.
We then did is we broke
the structural holes by
when we had mandatory training.
We had nurses from
disparate groups being in
the same class together.
Then they have a natural opportunity to
meet people that they would've otherwise met.
What we were able to find
after a few months of doing this,
no longer did you have to have
orderlies do it because that nurse that
needed the infusion pump now had a friend
in another group that had the excess.
And they were able to cross
collaborate
themselves to get what they needed.
That's an example of
structural holes and how you can
break the structural holes
to get better collaboration.
You might want structural holes, right?
If you're thinking about
military intelligence for example.
You might want a certain level of
compartmentalization so that nobody
can put the whole picture together, right?
But that also comes at
a cost of collaboration.
There's another idea of social capital.
Social capital is this idea.
It's not about what you know,
it's about who you know that's important.
It's an ability for
an individual to broker
knowledge and resources
across the organization.
It's usually developed through
informal interaction that
occurs in break rooms,
social events, external things. Not free.
It costs time, it costs social expectation,
it costs resources, right, to develop.
But if you're in
a knowledge intensive organization,
like a consulting firm or a firm,
creative firm and firm, something like that,
that requires a high level
of collaboration and creativity.
Social capital is very, very important.
If you're in a manufacturing organization,
maybe not as much, right?
Social capital is another concept
that we wanted to just
address when we think
about link optimization, right?
Like how somebody is
making decisions on the value
of their link and how much time they're going
to place into it, right?
One of my colleagues, map Shears,
came up with this idea of
there's like two axes that are important.
One is the frequency
of the time which you're connecting.
Right? Like you might have an old friend.
You have a lot of time spent,
shared memories, but you
don't see them very often.
You might have more frequent conversations
with people in your direct
family or people at work, right?
So there's that frequency.
Then the vertical axis
is the intimacy, right?
Is it a casual conversation or is it
somebody you've actually
really shared secrets with?
And?
Personal moments and bar your soul to you.
Right? That's the intimacy. And we
have these four quadrants, right?
Quadrant one, high frequency,
high intimacy might be a spouse, a coworker.
In quadrant four, there would be
somebody you spend a lot of time with,
but maybe it's more casual conversation.
The old friend is somebody that you've had
a certain level of intimacy
and shared experiences with,
but you don't see them as regularly.
And then quadrant three down,
there is a stranger, right?
The strength of a tie
doesn't follow frequency or intimacy.
It crosses both of them
and follows that diagonal line
there where quadrant three,
the weakest link in
quadrant one is the strongest.
Then that arrow that you see going to
the upper left is a lot of times social media
allows us to cache
intimacy without the frequency
necessary to maintain it.
It allows you to cache
relationships of value.
Right, there is this pad space.
As far as what
I'm showing you there is like going up
the gradient hill there on what's
most important social media
allows us to cache a lot of that.
We can access old friends
when we need them for
something tragic that's happened.
It also allows us to
maintain the illusion of being connected
because you post pictures
of what you're doing and little posts of
what you're thinking on social media gives
us the maintenance of
the relationship with much lower cost.
When we think about the hierarchy
of social link motivation,
and this largely comes out of
the Ket study I described earlier.
We see that initially
people are trying to affiliate with a group.
These are weak ties
and loose social affiliations.
And the main motivation
is some type of status
or prestige is what's
driving their behavior in that group.
Once they've affiliated,
the next step is forming.
This is where they're going to
establish links for validation,
identity validation and for
being able to access resources.
Now, things like homofily
reciprocity proximity kick in,
right, as we're those relationships.
Then there's the conforming stage.
This is where social norms are established,
social conformity, group acceptance,
all of that comes in.
Again, we go back to
a little bit to prestige.
We're dealing with like influence and power.
People are jockeying
for leadership and positions
and where they're at
the pecking order, so to speak.
And then the last stage becomes optimization.
This is where we're trying to
maximize the utility data,
social network, minimize our effort.
That's where things like
transitivity, structural holes,
social capital link optimization, balance,
cluster ability all come
in into play where we're at.
You can almost see by looking at
what forces are significantly
at play in a particular group,
you can almost infer where they're in
their structure for
organization and performing.
Now, there's other theories, right?
You've heard of forming Storming, Norming,
performing common one for group development.
I'm just mapping where that
fits in with this social link motivation.
I think before you have
that small group development,
you have that affiliation stage.
I think that that performing
functional role relatedness
is an organizational structure
that you're applying on top of
the network to try and
shape it to achieve
a business objective more than the
naturally occurring one that
would happen from people in that group.
Understanding where a group
is in their development
provides insights into what
motivations are driving them.
I think it gives you some different insights
from a leadership perspective.
Might give you different targeting
strategies for how you want to
change the trajectory of
that group or how they're behaving.
I think the purpose and the mission of
the group may also impact some of
your decisions as far as how you're going to
target interventions in that group.
This has been a lecture on social theories.
I know this has been a bit long,
but I appreciate you staying with me.
I'm Dr. Ian Mccullough
and I will see you soon.

Hello,
I'm Dr. A Mcculloch and in this lecture
we're going to be
talking about organizational theories.
These are organizations, it's
not exactly social media.
It's more talking about like
a workplace civic organization, those things.
But it's important to understand
organizational theories that have
been more deeply explored.
Because it will help inform how
we think about organizations that
maybe are online or
organized in a more volunteer sense.
In a more social sense,
that's the purpose of why
we're looking at this right now.
When you look at an organizational spectrum,
there is agility on one hand,
efficiency on the other.
You may have heard that
efficient organizations
aren't very adaptive,
or innovative, and
agile organizations
aren't particularly efficient.
That's somewhat true,
but I don't believe that they
are necessarily the opposite of one another.
There's just optimizing to different things.
But let's look and
see what's
different about these organizations.
An efficient organization has
a very well defined task and purpose.
There's a lot of high repetition,
it's all based on creating
standards and quality control.
You might see Lean Six Sigma
is key in this type of an environment.
We're reducing waste, minimizing costs.
There's usually a hierarchy
or supervision that's making
sure that people are doing things
the right way to standard.
We're not looking for people
to come up with a lot of innovation.
If you have an idea, great,
let's tell it to engineering.
They will test it to see if
it actually makes things better.
But you're going to do it the way it's
supposed to be doing, being done.
You want to have a single unitary unity of
leadership and
social interaction in that environment,
right,
When you're talking to your colleagues,
that's a distraction from
the manufacturing line
or whatever you're doing.
Let's contrast that to agility,
right? This is pioneering.
There's no defined task, right?
Everything's a one off, there's high novelty.
It's not been done before.
They're looking for a lot of
creativity and diversity of ideas, right?
We want to have innovation maximizing
new ideas, not minimizing waste.
You're looking for organic collaboration.
You might have a flat structure with
many different bosses and
the social interaction is now value.
It's creating social capital.
It's allowing you to broker knowledge and
resources across the organization.
It's positive thing, you're seeing
the networks on the left agility
and on the right efficiency.
When you look at the excessive number of
links that exist and
think about that in
the context of links aren't free.
They take time and energy
to develop and maintain.
There's a lot of inefficiency in
all of those connections that are going on.
But it's necessary to be able to have
a quicker tie to resources,
knowledge, innovation,
different thoughts to get the solution done.
We can measure organizational efficiency.
David Crack Heart has a great paper,
I think it's in your reading he identified
four properties of an efficient organization.
One is it's connected,
there's no isolate hanging out by themselves.
The other one is it's hierarchic,
There's no reciprocity,
communication goes one direction.
It's efficient in that there's
no cross talk between groups.
And least up or bound means
that there's unity in leadership.
There's one boss.
What you're seeing is examples in
the middle here of an efficient organization.
It's connectivity is one,
nobody's on their own.
It's hierarchy is one.
Communication goes one way.
There's high graph efficiency.
There's no Crosstalk between people.
It's boss, subordinate, least upper bound.
There's a single boss, a person
in charge, nobody else.
When you look at these other networks,
you're seeing examples of inefficient, right?
The upper left is connectivity is zero.
Everybody's isolate hierarchy is zero, right?
All ties are reciprocal.
Lower left graph efficiency is zero,
everybody's connected to everybody.
The lower right least upper bound is zero.
There's one guy that has five bosses, right?
That's not particularly efficient.
And there's ways you can
go into the paper if you want.
You can actually measure the level
of efficiency in the organization.
But what I want to think about is if
we look at those four types, right?
Let's look and see what we're
looking for in an Agile network.
We want knowledge, resource exchange,
we want reduced management overhead.
We want to have in which
innovation comes from cognitive diversity.
I'm not talking ethnic diversity,
or racial diversity, or gender diversity.
I'm saying different ways in
which you can look at problems, Right?
Cognitive diversity, that might
come from different race,
but not necessarily. Right?
People are defined by a lot more than race.
Cognitive diversity, inclusion.
It does you no good
if you have diverse people,
but they don't have an equal voice at
the table time social opportunity.
Let's contrast that to
those four categories
of an efficient organization.
Well, if I want to have
knowledge and resource exchange,
I need a connected organization to see.
It's not the opposite. If I
want to have knowledge and resource,
right, an efficient organization
that is no cross talk
is not particularly helpful.
I need to have that cross
talk so people can go and ask
questions of their peers and get access to
their unique knowledge and
resources in a diverse organization.
That hierarchy, right,
is not necessarily good for having
reduced management overhead
and it certainly does not
promote inclusion in the organization
that's not necessarily a good one.
Cognitive diversity and time,
it's unclear what the tie
in is to an efficient organization.
There, it's just not clear
that Agile is the opposite of efficient.
There's different aspects that
we need to think about.
What ideally we would like to do is maximize
the values in an Agile organization
without becoming too inefficient.
So there's a couple other theories
that I like to discuss.
One is called Network Horizon.
What Network Horizon suggests
is your awareness of knowledge and
resources in the organization
decays to zero at three steps.
You have a pretty good idea of the people
you work with on a regular basis.
You have a pretty good idea
of what they know,
what their skills are,
what you can draw from them.
You might have an idea of people that
are one step removed, right?
But beyond that, the likelihood
you'll know who they are or be
able to reach out and access
them is highly unlikely.
The other one that's interesting
is this idea of span of control and
time and resources of
span of control is that as relationship,
as groups get larger,
the complexity of them grows exponentially.
If I'm person A is talking to person B,
right? They have a relationship.
Now, when you add person in the mix, well,
person is going to
respond differently to person in the presence
of B will respond
differently to the person A
in the presence of
C. B and C
are going to have the same difference, right?
A and C are going
to have the same difference.
It's not just added one node and you
added two extra relationships.
You actually changed the relationship
between the first two in different ways.
They've changed the relationship
with each of them
with a new persons coming in.
That's much higher when you
actually work out the combinatorics of that.
By the time you get about six
people in the organization,
you're dealing with almost 200
different potential relationship dynamics
that are going on there,
which seems like quite high.
It quickly then exceeds
your think about the Dunbar number.
As far as being able
to how many relationships
we can keep cognitively in our brains,
it quickly blows up and gets out of control.
That's why in an
organization where you have a lot of
interlocking projects where people
have to have a lot of collaboration,
a manager span of
control is only about six people.
But if you're dealing with
the example with Sears and Roebuck,
right,
they had like 20 different departments.
And whoever is selling like
women's fashion doesn't really
have to deal with men's tools,
right? This is back in the day.
Then that manager can have
like 20 people and be fine, right?
But the more they have to actually interact,
the more they have to be
aware of those groups and
the smaller that span of control is, right.
That's another aspect that's going
on in this collaborative environment.
How do we create truly agile networks?
Well, I would argue that we need
to minimize the diameter of the network.
That means that your ability to get access to
information on the other side of
the network is relatively small.
But we also want to minimize
the average degree or
the density of the actors,
and we want to maximize cognitive diversity.
If I look at these just three toy networks,
we'll see that the diameter on the one on
the left is two, right?
The density is 0.4 When I
go to the middle one,
I can shrink the diameter to one,
but now my density gets much higher.
If I go to the network on the right,
I still have a diameter of two.
But my density is a little bit
difficult or a little bit more.
I would say that the one on
the left is a better structure
for being agile and efficient.
Not only works because it's a star network,
and as you start adding more
and more nodes to that,
that doesn't necessarily map out.
But this is where we can start thinking about
networks in terms of diameter and density.
As a way to think about
how agile they really are.
I would say that there is no clean set of
metrics for agile organizations like
there is for efficient organizations
that crack heart had come up with,
again, the factors affecting
actor relationships in organizations.
Let's go back to
the six social forces of prestige.
Homophile, proximity,
reciprocity, transitivity and balance,
which we've talked about in another lecture.
Other theories that are at play here
are these ideas of
identity and self validation,
social circles, social exchange
theory conformity, structural holes.
Social capital, really important
in Agile organizations that
you invest in social capital,
you've got to think about how all
of these factors that we've discussed
in this module come to
play in organizational dynamics.
They also drive
platform specific recommender systems
for friends in social media.
You know, when a social media says, hey,
you might want to connect to this person,
you might like to this person, right?
That's all driven by these theories,
manifested in the platform,
different weights, different
strengths for each of these.
But that's what's driving the behavior.
I'm Dr. A. Mccullough.
Thank you for joining me for
this short lecture on
organizational networks.
