- Structural holes
  - Occur when two clusters lack cross-ties and a sole broker connects them.
  - Brokers hold informal power; maintaining brokerage is cognitively demanding.
  - Networks tend toward redundant ties; preserving structural holes may require effort.
  - Structural holes can be broken by creating cross-group interaction (office groups, social events, mixed training).
  - Case: infusion pumps at a hospital — RFID tracking revealed departmental structural holes (e.g., oncology isolated). Mandatory mixed training let nurses form cross-group ties, enabling direct resource sharing and reducing need for intermediaries.
  - Sometimes structural holes are desirable (e.g., compartmentalization in military intelligence) but they reduce collaboration.

- Social capital
  - Defined as “who you know” — ability to broker knowledge and resources across an organization.
  - Built through informal interactions (break rooms, social events) and carries time and resource costs.
  - Especially valuable in knowledge-intensive, collaborative, creative organizations; less critical in routine manufacturing contexts.
  - Influences decisions about link investment and link optimization.

- Tie strength model (two axes: frequency vs. intimacy)
  - Frequency = how often interactions occur; intimacy = depth of shared personal information.
  - Four quadrants:
    - High frequency, high intimacy: strongest ties (e.g., spouse, close coworker).
    - Low frequency, high intimacy: old friends with shared history.
    - High frequency, low intimacy: frequent but casual contacts (e.g., some coworkers).
    - Low frequency, low intimacy: strangers (weakest ties).
  - Tie strength follows a diagonal from low/low to high/high.
  - Social media can “cache” intimacy without maintaining high-frequency interactions, lowering maintenance cost and sometimes creating an illusion of connection.

- Hierarchy of social link motivation (stages)
  - Affiliation: form weak ties and group membership driven by status/prestige.
  - Forming: establish links for identity validation and resource access; homophily, reciprocity, proximity become active.
  - Conforming: establish norms, social conformity, group acceptance; influence and leadership jockeying occur.
  - Optimization: maximize network utility and minimize effort using transitivity, structural holes, social capital, link optimization, balance, clusterability.
  - Observable network forces can indicate a group’s developmental stage and inform intervention strategies.
  - Small-group development models (forming–storming–norming–performing) map onto these stages: affiliation precedes small-group development; performing corresponds to applying organizational role structures to achieve specific objectives.
  - Group purpose and mission affect which interventions and targeting strategies will be effective.

- Efficient organizations
  - Well-defined tasks and purpose, high repetition
  - Emphasis on standards, quality control, waste reduction (e.g., Lean Six Sigma)
  - Hierarchical supervision, unity of leadership (single boss)
  - Low tolerance for social interaction that distracts from tasks; innovation routed to engineering/testing
  - Optimizes cost/minimization rather than creativity

- Agile organizations
  - Pioneering work, undefined tasks, high novelty, many one-offs
  - Emphasis on creativity, cognitive diversity, and organic collaboration
  - Flatter structures, multiple informal leaders, social interaction creates social capital and brokers knowledge/resources
  - Prioritizes innovation and rapid access to diverse ideas over strict efficiency

- Tradeoffs and complementarities
  - Efficiency and agility optimize different values; not strictly opposites but often in tension
  - Goal: maximize agile values without becoming prohibitively inefficient

- Krackhardt’s four measurable properties of efficient organizations (as cited)
  - Connected: no isolates
  - Hierarchic: communication is largely one-directional (no reciprocity)
  - Graph efficiency: minimal cross-talk between groups
  - Least upper bound: unity in leadership (single boss)
  - Example inefficient patterns: isolates (connectivity=0), full reciprocity (hierarchy=0), everybody connected (graph efficiency=0), multiple bosses (least upper bound=0)

- Requirements for agile networks
  - Knowledge and resource exchange (requires connectivity and cross-talk)
  - Reduced management overhead
  - Innovation from cognitive diversity (different problem-solving perspectives)
  - Inclusion and equal voice — diversity without equal voice is ineffective

- Network Horizon
  - Awareness of organizational knowledge/resources decays to near zero after three steps (direct collaborators known; beyond one or two steps access/awareness drops sharply)

- Span of control and interaction complexity
  - Adding members increases relationship complexity combinatorially; six people can generate ~200 potential relationship dynamics
  - High-interaction teams require small managerial spans (~6); siloed or non-interacting units can support much larger spans (example: separate departments)

- Designing agile networks (graph metrics)
  - Minimize network diameter (shortest path lengths to resources/info)
  - Minimize average degree/density (limit costly ties)
  - Maximize cognitive diversity
  - Toy-network comparison: star-like structures can keep diameter small with lower density; fully connected hubs reduce diameter but increase density and maintenance costs

- Social/structural theories and forces relevant to organizational networks
  - Six social forces of prestige / tie formation (listed): homophily, proximity, reciprocity, transitivity, balance
  - Other relevant concepts: identity and self-validation, social circles, social exchange theory, conformity, structural holes, social capital
  - Social capital investment is critical for agile organizations; these factors shape organizational dynamics

- Application to platforms
  - These organizational and network theories inform platform recommender systems (friend/connection suggestions), with different weights and strengths manifesting as platform-driven behaviors

# Summary (concise details)

- Scientific-method framing
  - Observe (exploratory data, interviews, lived experience) → form hypothesis → collect data → test → iterate.

- Objectives mentioned
  - Describe/distinguish six social forces (only some detailed here).
  - Understand hierarchy of social link formation.
  - Learn basic social theories relevant to social network analysis, including online vs face-to-face differences.

- Why humans connect (identity & neurobiology)
  - Looking-Glass Self: self-identity develops via imagining how others perceive/judge one.
  - Von Economo neurons: long neurons involved in rapid social processing across large cerebral cortex.
  - Mirror neurons: automatic emotional/behavioral mirroring and empathy; engagement with narratives activates related brain regions.
  - Theory of Mind: develops ~4–5 years; allows understanding that others hold different perspectives.
  - Erickson / Rogers: social groups and attachment are central to identity, self-worth, belonging.

- Cognitive and biological constraints on network size
  - Dunbar’s number: primate group size correlates with cortical surface; human primary group ≈ 150.
  - Killworth & Bernard recall studies: average recalled people ≈ 231, max ≈ 290 (method-dependent; indicates upper limit exists).
  - Individual differences in cognitive capacity to maintain relationships.

- Observed everyday contact vs online ties
  - Meaningful conversations per day: software developers ~6–8; business/management roles ~15–20.
  - Online connections (example Facebook) often much larger (hundreds to thousands) despite far fewer meaningful interactions.
  - Removing maintenance/time constraints changes network structure; one-click online links require little upkeep.

- Constraints on relationship formation (Maheu & Levenger, 1976)
  - Nature of the relationship (online vs face-to-face, acquaintance vs meaningful).
  - Time investment required.
  - Cognitive limitations of actors.

- Strategies people use to build networks
  - Many low-value ties (many acquaintances) vs few high-value intense ties.
  - Diversification across social circles (distinct foci/social objects: family, work, church, hobbies).
  - Resource heterophily: deliberately connecting to diverse others to access different resources.
  - Identity reinforcement: choosing similar others to validate self.

- Social exchange theory (illustrative “Oreos & milk”)
  - Exchange of complementary goods/resources leads to mutual benefit.
  - Two-node networks tend toward even exchange.
  - Three-node networks: central broker node can capture surplus/resources by controlling exchanges between two others.
  - Four-node networks: when actors are blind to network position, exchanges stay local; when shown their network positions, central actors exploit brokerage and capture more resources.
  - Centrality correlates with degree of resource capture; reciprocity motivates exchange (even small favors increase likelihood of reciprocation).
  - Exchange outcomes tie strongly to power and positional advantage in the network.

- Homophily (birds of a feather)
  - Similarity increases probability of tie formation; similarity can be perceived and asymmetric.
  - Homophily attributes not fixed; perceived similarity and salience matter.
  - Cultural domain / free-list methods: elicit salient attributes (e.g., admire someone → list characteristics) and compare self vs other to quantify perceived similarity.
  - Homophily is dynamic: increased information/exposure can strengthen or weaken perceived similarity and tie strength.

- West Point longitudinal study (graduate cohort example)
  - Weekly surveys + device logs (email/calls) used to track tie formation over time.
  - Early friendship formation: race was strongest factor in the first five weeks.
  - After ~5 weeks, religion became a stronger organizing factor (e.g., reinforcement via shared chapel attendance).
  - Contextual factors (isolated base, shared workplaces, schools, housing) influenced which foci reinforced ties and how groups clustered.

- Reciprocity (as a social force)
  - Giving compels return giving; lowers cost of establishing links.
  - Lack of reciprocity leads to link decay (people stop investing in unrewarded ties).
  - Reciprocity can apply to negative acts (reciprocal negative relationships escalate).
  - Reciprocity underlies many small social nudges (e.g., freebies increasing compliance).

- Additional methodological/note points
  - Online and offline dynamics may differ; many social theories adapted to online remain unproven or behave differently.
  - Network visibility affects behavior: revealing network structure can change exchange patterns and increase exploitation by central actors.

- Proximity
  - People nearer in physical or organizational space are more likely to form ties; proximity increases opportunities for interaction and discovery.
  - Semantic/visibility space model: physical movement segments → nodes → a network of navigable/visible segments; line-of-sight and viewing angle matter more than Euclidean distance in open offices.
  - Positional advantage: individuals with greater visibility/line-of-sight are more likely to be connected.
  - Open-office findings:
    - Increased collaboration for people within ~20 meters; benefits disappear beyond ~20 m.
    - Increased distraction, noise, loss of privacy; women report greater pressure (appearance/behavior) and potential disadvantage in open plans.
    - Need for dedicated collaborative spaces (not just open desks) to realize benefits.
  - Applied Physics Lab (APL) study:
    - Groups moved from two-person offices to mixed/open-plan facility; 18 months of data collection; matched-sample design.
    - Instrumentation: e-mail server logs, anonymized audio/noise estimates, floor mats for movement, observational measures, surveys of satisfaction/productivity/collaboration.
    - Outcomes: measured space utilization, changes in e-mail network structure, perceived collaboration/awareness; found less toxic leadership in open plan, positional advantages, trade-offs between collaboration and distraction.
    - Results informed design of a later $82M building on campus.

- Prestige
  - Prestige/status is culturally dependent; different fields use different metrics (military badges/combat, sports statistics, academic publications/grants/students).
  - Prestige is defended/maintained; associating with lower-status actors can threaten perceived prestige (homophily in status).
  - Gender/context differences: men and women often have different prestige drivers in Western contexts (work/status vs. family/children), though causes (cultural/biological) are debated.
  - Rap “diss” network study (example):
    - Directed links from one rapper dissing another; prestige proxied by record sales.
    - Dynamics: being dissed usually lowers status, but effective responses can raise status; a little-known rapper dissing a big rapper can raise the little rapper’s visibility; a big rapper responding to a small rapper can lower the big rapper’s status.
  - Obedience/conformity links to prestige/authority:
    - Milgram obedience result: ~65% administered shocks when instructed by authority.
    - Position/centrality in networks increases opinion leadership over group norms.

- Conformity and network effects (empirical examples)
  - Asch line experiment: ~37% conformity on critical trials; informational vs. normative conformity.
  - Platoon study:
    - Social networks collected (friend/time/respect); military trivia test (15 questions) used to provoke conformity.
    - Central members rarely conformed (one central person conformed twice; others zero), peripheral members conformed frequently (average ~13/15).
    - Centrality vs. conformity: strong negative correlation (~−0.84).
  - Mental-health longitudinal study of an infantry brigade:
    - Psychometrics before, during, and after deployment.
    - Peripheral/less-accepted individuals were more likely to develop depression, PTSD, and suicidal ideation.
  - Claim: network position can explain a large portion (~85%) of conformity dynamics (as argued in the material).

- Transitivity
  - Principle: if person A knows B and C, B and C are more likely to form a tie (triadic closure).
  - Mathematical/empirical treatment:
    - Triad-based counts (16 triad types) used to identify transitive/closed triads.
    - Geometrically weighted edgewise shared partners (GWESP): each additional shared partner increases tie probability but with diminishing returns; shape/decay parameter can be fit to data.
  - Transitivity assessed statistically via triad-completion tendencies in network models.

- Balance theory
  - Core rules: friend-of-my-friend → friend; friend-of-my-enemy → enemy; enemy-of-my-enemy → friend.
  - Relationships can be positive or negative; triads are balanced if the product of the three signed ties is positive.
  - Example (complex tribal/political alignment):
    - Afghan example: individuals may have positive ties to both the US (security/economy) and Taliban (shared culture/religion) while US and Taliban are negative toward each other → cognitive dissonance.
    - Multiple groups (e.g., Pashtun vs. Hazara) produce cascading positive/negative ties; changing one intergroup tie can shift others but can backfire or re-align unpredictably.
  - Systemic consequences:
    - If balance theory dominates, networks tend to bifurcate into two opposing camps.
    - In multi-party political systems, coalition-forming to pass legislation creates de facto two-block dynamics; party coalitions constrain individual dissent.
  - Formal criterion: triad with (+,+,+) is balanced; (+,+,−) is imbalanced; imbalanced triads persist only if other social forces counteract balance.

- Methods/metrics mentioned
  - Adjacency matrices and triad algebra (transitivity as closure / A^2 ≈ A in triad terms).
  - Instrumentation: e-mail logs, audio/noise sensors, movement mats, surveys, matched-sample longitudinal designs.
  - Network statistics: centrality measures, triad type counts, GWESP for transitivity, signed triad products for balance.
