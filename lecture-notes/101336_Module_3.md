- History / motivation
  - RESTful APIs gained prominence after Fielding’s 2000 dissertation, enabling networks + software convergence and third-party access to platform data.
  - Exposing standardized data enables external apps to use a platform (marketplaces like Amazon/eBay), increasing platform value.
  - Early implementations (e.g., Flickr) experienced issues when REST/formatting wasn't standardized.

- Good API practices
  - Support concrete business use cases; do not expose all data (proprietary, cost, complexity reasons).
  - Prioritize and narrowly define what API access is allowed.
  - Provide detailed, easy-to-use documentation to lower friction for third-party developers.
  - Maintain API stability even when internal systems change; unstable APIs force clients to incur development costs.

- Causes & consequences of API changes
  - APIs change frequently for legal/compliance reasons, public backlash, advertiser/market shifts, political decisions, or platform policy changes.
  - Example impact: major platform ownership changes have led to abrupt API modifications, breaking dependent tools and requiring redevelopment.

- Data virtualization & AI-assisted data handling
  - Data virtualization: retrieve/manipulate data without exposing full technical details; simplifies search/identification/transformation.
  - AI can augment human data manipulation; one approach uses symbolic AI rather than declarative relational algebra (SQL-style).
  - Symbolic AI approach: identify first-order logic relationships, accept a desired outcome statement, and produce an optimal transformation/migration plan—reducing time and cost for data/query migrations and transformations.

- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
  - Human-readable text format using name–value pairs separated by commas; objects in { }, arrays in [ ].
  - Example product JSON structure: id, name (e.g., "Ice sculpture"), price, tags (array), dimensions (object), warehouse location (nested object).
  - Example use for institutional data: JSON endpoint for a site (e.g., a university resource) can expose a large JSON file; rendered HTML view differs from raw JSON.
  - Example schema for people: instructors/faculty objects with firstName, lastName, courses; alumni objects with firstName, lastName, degree, graduationYear, employer.

- XML (Extensible Markup Language)
  - Tag-based markup using <tag>...</tag> syntax; nested elements closed with slash-tag.
  - Same data modeled with XML: elements for firstName, lastName, course, etc., each enclosed in opening and closing tags.
  - XML vs JSON is primarily syntax/structure difference; both can represent the same nested data.

- Performance & adoption tradeoffs
  - JSON generally has better performance: lower memory use and faster parsing.
  - XML remains in use because many developers find it more readable/interpret able and training/retooling costs can favor keeping XML.
  - Trend: newer developers are becoming familiar with both formats and adoption is shifting toward JSON for performance reasons.

- Practical classroom/application note
  - Social media APIs are unstable and change often; practical work requires students/developers to locate and adapt to currently working APIs rather than rely on fixed endpoints.

- Online trespass
  - Platforms argued that unauthorized scraping equals trespass; courts have generally rejected trespass claims when data is publicly accessible.
  - Bidders Edge vs. eBay: injunction issued because heavy scraping traffic risked disrupting service (denial-of-service) — liability tied to disruption, not mere access.
  - Other unsuccessful trespass attempts: Perfect 10 v. Google, Event v. EventBright.
  - Analogy used: publicly accessible site ≈ sidewalk (public access) rather than private house interior.

- Copyright and content scraping
  - Cases: Facebook v. Power.com and Associated Press v. Meltwater — copyright claims raised against scraping/publishing content.
  - Distinction: using facts or information derived from scraped content is generally not copyright infringement; copying content verbatim or republishing protected expression may be.
  - Workarounds/examples:
    - Bookmarking/aggregation (GetPocket-style) that directs users to original sources and credits them can avoid infringement.
    - Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) encourage authors to host content in friendly formats.
  - Fair use: limited, transformative uses (commentary, criticism, parody) are permissible; original words/images/logos may remain protected.

- Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) — key points
  - Safe Harbor shields platforms from user infringing acts if procedures are followed.
  - Notice-and-takedown: copyright holders can request removal of infringing content; platforms must comply and implement mechanisms to prevent re-uploads (notice-and-stay-down).
  - Anti-circumvention: prohibits bypassing DRM to obtain copyrighted content; does not broadly forbid accessing raw data unrelated to copyright protection.
  - Exceptions exist for distance education/online learning.

- Fraud and Abuse / Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
  - CFAA prohibits knowingly accessing computer systems without authorization or exceeding authorized access; covers hacking, password trafficking, unauthorized government computer access, intentional damage (e.g., DDoS).
  - LinkedIn litigation against data-scraping analytics companies attempted to invoke CFAA; courts (Ninth Circuit referenced) have allowed scraping of publicly available data when no authorization barrier existed.
  - Damages and liability often hinge on denial-of-service or actual disruption to platform operations (e.g., QVC v. Result successful due to excessive scraping causing operational harm).
  - Case noted where initial conviction for identity/theft-related access was overturned because the targeted site lacked sufficient access barriers (transcript reference: U.S. v. Arnheim).

- Privacy and platform liability
  - European “right to be forgotten” allows requests to remove outdated/irrelevant links from search engines; no exact U.S. equivalent cited.
  - Platform settlements/penalties for deceptive practices or improper data handling:
    - Snapchat settled with FTC over misrepresenting disappearing messages and retaining user data.
    - Twitter faced class-action for alleged sharing of private direct messages.
    - Cambridge Analytica: illegal collection/use of privileged Facebook data for political targeting → major regulatory/settlement consequences; Facebook found complicit in some respects.
    - YouTube settled with FTC over collecting personal information from children under 13 (COPPA).
  - Platforms can be held liable when complicit or deceptive about data practices.

- Practical rules and best practices for scraping
  - Avoid degrading or burdening the target site’s performance; respect rate limits and avoid generating denial-of-service effects.
  - Do not collect sensitive personally identifiable information (SSNs, passport numbers, etc.).
  - Respect copyright: extract facts/raw data and transform/interpret rather than republish protected expressions.
  - Common evasion tactics exist (rotating tokens, varied IPs, changing request patterns) but raise ethical/legal risk and may trigger platform countermeasures.

- Contracts, terms of service, and authorization
  - Enforceability of terms-of-use as binding contract can be uncertain: requirements for meeting of the minds and consideration may be questioned when access is free and users do not meaningfully review lengthy TOS.
  - Whether agreeing to TOS creates an authorization that limits scraping remains unsettled in courts.

- Platform responses and incentives
  - Platforms commonly change APIs, introduce rate limits, CAPTCHA, content-recognition, and other barriers after scraping incidents or reputation attacks.
  - Reputation attacks or publications exposing platform vulnerabilities can provoke rapid platform countermeasures (example: mass bot takedown correlated with API changes and access restrictions for certain institutional emails).
  - Private entities face fewer statutory constraints than government actors; government data collection is subject to stronger oversight and legal guardrails.

- Overarching takeaway (legal landscape)
  - Publicly accessible data is often treated as lawful to collect, but liability arises from site disruption, unauthorized access to protected systems, copyright infringement of expressive content, collection of sensitive PII, contractual violations (where enforceable), or deceptive/complicit platform behavior.
  - Platforms bear primary responsibility to protect data and implement access controls; scraping practices and platform defenses continually evolve.
  - Information presented is not legal advice; actions carry individual legal risk.
