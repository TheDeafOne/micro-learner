# Project Progress

## Approach
- Build a FastAPI + SQLite backend for Canvas course ingestion and transcript/summary generation.
- Keep the infrastructure minimal (no Redis/SSE/OAuth) while providing a clear path for frontend integration and later provider upgrades.
- Use Playwright with persistent auth to reuse SSO state headlessly, allowing reliable Panopto/Zoom transcript fetching.
- Layer on a lightweight React dashboard (Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui) that speaks directly to the API for manual workflows before automating further.

## Work Completed
- Initialized backend structure with SQLModel models, settings loader, storage helpers, fake provider, and summarizer stub.
- Implemented Canvas client, data refresh endpoints, and background transcript/summary jobs with artifact tracking.
- Added Playwright-based Panopto/Zoom scrapers plus reusable launcher to support persistent profile + storage-state cookies.
- Migrated SSO setup helper and documented the workflow for creating `playwright-state.json`.
- Expanded API surface for frontend use: robust sync error handling, course/module/item/artifact browse endpoints, item filters, download routes, and reset action.
- Enforced improved logging for background tasks and consolidated artifact cleanup/reset flows.
- Scaffolded a Vite + React + TypeScript frontend with Tailwind and shadcn/ui, including shared API helpers, UI primitives, and theming.
- Built a course/module/item explorer that consumes the backend, allows filtering by provider/status/search, queues transcript/summary jobs, and surfaces artifact download links.
- Documented the frontend setup (`frontend/README.md`, `.env.example`) and linked the workflow from the root README.

## Current Status
- Backend remains the source of truth with healthy background job orchestration; frontend is functional for manual oversight and runs `npm run build` cleanly.
- Environment docs cover both backend and frontend; build artifacts verified via `npx vite build` and `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Next steps: add real provider integrations or OpenAI summaries, introduce job status polling / notifications in the frontend, and expand automated test coverage across both layers.
