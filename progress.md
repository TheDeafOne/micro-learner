# Project Progress

## Approach
- Build a FastAPI + SQLite backend for Canvas course ingestion and transcript/summary generation.
- Keep the infrastructure minimal (no Redis/SSE/OAuth) while providing a clear path for frontend integration and later provider upgrades.
- Use Playwright with persistent auth to reuse SSO state headlessly, allowing reliable Panopto/Zoom transcript fetching.

## Work Completed
- Initialized backend structure with SQLModel models, settings loader, storage helpers, fake provider, and summarizer stub.
- Implemented Canvas client, data refresh endpoints, and background transcript/summary jobs with artifact tracking.
- Added Playwright-based Panopto/Zoom scrapers plus reusable launcher to support persistent profile + storage-state cookies.
- Migrated SSO setup helper and documented the workflow for creating `playwright-state.json`.
- Expanded API surface for frontend use: robust sync error handling, course/module/item/artifact browse endpoints, item filters, download routes, and reset action.
- Enforced improved logging for background tasks and consolidated artifact cleanup/reset flows.

## Current Status
- All endpoints return structured responses ready for a frontend; transcript jobs run headlessly using captured auth state.
- README and `.env` document the configuration knobs and new routes; `progress.md` captures ongoing milestones.
- Next steps: connect frontend UI to the browse/filter/endpoints, add real provider integrations or API keys (OpenAI, Playwright enhancements), and expand testing coverage.
